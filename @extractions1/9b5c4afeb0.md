## Build Apache Any23 from sources

This page describes how to build **Apache Any23**.

### Access a Snapshot Version

For the latest snapshot please checkout the code from the public Git repository and build the library. Checkout the code from Github:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/any23.git
```

### Build **Apache Any23**

The following instructions describe how to build the library with [Maven 3.x.y+](http://maven.apache.org/). For specific information about Maven see:  Go to the any23 folder:

```
$ cd any23/
```

and execute the following command:

```
any23$ mvn clean install
```

This will install the **Apache Any23** artifact and its dependencies in your local M2 repository.

### Generate Documentation

To generate the project site locally execute the following command from the any23 dir:

```
any23$ MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1024m' mvn clean site
```

You can speed up the site generation process specifying the offline option ( -o ), but it works only if all the involved plugin dependencies has been already downloaded in the local M2 repository:

```
any23$ MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx1024m' mvn -o clean site
```

If you're interested in generating the Javadoc enriched with navigable UML graphs, you can activate the umlgraphdoc profile. This profile relies on [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) that must be installed in your system.

```
any23$ MAVEN_OPTS='-Xmx256m' mvn -P umlgraphdoc clean site
```
