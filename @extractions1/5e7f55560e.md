## About the Author

I went [winter backpacking solo](http://www.backpacker.com/skills/beginner/winter-camping/cold-comfort-winter-camping-guide/), stayed warm and healthy, and had a great time. On one trip, a farmer on a road I was walking said 14 inches of snow had fallen the night before. I slept, with my sleeping bag, tent, and the rest, on that snow in the woods in the mountains. I did not put on my wool pants or hang my tent liner, and I had both in good condition. I have an aversion to dying, so I spent about a year or two before that learning the skills and background needed to do it safely. That was a long time ago, but I’ve noticed that the city where I live is not as cold as most people seem to think. They bundle up. I don’t need to.
