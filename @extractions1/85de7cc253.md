# h-card

From Microformats Wiki

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

h-card is a simple, open format for publishing people and organisations on the web. h-card is often used on home pages and individual blog posts. h-card is one of several open [microformat](/wiki/microformats "microformats") draft standards suitable for embedding data in HTML.

h-card is the [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") update to [hCard](/wiki/hCard "hCard").

Status
:   This is a **Living Specification** yet mature enough to encourage additional implementations and [feedback](https://github.com/microformats/h-card/issues).

## Example

Here are a couple of minimal examples:

```
<a class="h-card" href="https://tantek.com/">Tantek Çelik</a>, 

<span class="h-card">
  <a class="p-name p-org u-url" href="https://microformats.org/">microformats.org</a>
</span>

```

Parsed JSON:

```
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": ["h-card"],
      "properties": {
        "name": ["Tantek Çelik"],
        "url": ["https://tantek.com/"]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": ["h-card"],
      "properties": {
        "name": ["microformats.org"],
        "org": ["microformats.org"],
        "url": ["https://microformats.org/"]
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

Note a single element was sufficient for the simple person example with implied name and URL properties, while for an organization, which requires a name and org, it needed explicit markup for the h-card and all properties, though still with only two elements.

Nested h-card example:

```
<div class="h-card">
  <a class="p-name u-url"
     href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/" 
    >Mitchell Baker</a> 
  (<a class="p-org h-card" 
      href="https://mozilla.org/"
     >Mozilla Foundation</a>)
</div>

```

Parsed JSON:

```
{
  "items": [{ 
    "type": ["h-card"],
    "properties": {
      "name": ["Mitchell Baker"],
      "url": ["https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/"],
      "org": [{
        "value": "Mozilla Foundation",
        "type": ["h-card"],
        "properties": {
          "name": ["Mozilla Foundation"],
          "url": ["https://mozilla.org/"]
        }
      }]
    }
  }]
}

```

Note: the nested h-card has implied 'name' and 'url' properties, just like any other root-class-name-only h-card on an `<a href>` would.

### Get started

The class **`h-card`** is a *root class name* that indicates the presence of an h-card.

For minimal examples where at most `p-name`, `u-url` and `u-photo` are required (such as the first given above), only the root class name is needed — see [implied properties](/wiki/microformats-2-implied-properties "microformats-2-implied-properties").

When more than those three minimal properties are needed, the root class name must be placed on an element which encloses all the desired properties, and then the properties themselves marked up using the classnames given below.

See [microformats2-parsing](/wiki/microformats2-parsing "microformats2-parsing") to learn more about property classnames.

## Properties

h-card properties, inside an element with class **h-card**. All properties are both optional and may have multiple instances, e.g. multiple name, url, photo etc. properties.

* See [microformats2-parsing](/wiki/microformats2-parsing "microformats2-parsing") to learn more about property classnames.

Example h-card with common properties:

* `<div class="h-card">`
  + `<span class="p-name">Sally Ride</span>`
  + `<span class="p-honorific-prefix">Dr.</span>`
  + `<span class="p-given-name">Sally</span>`
  + `<abbr class="p-additional-name">K.</abbr>`
  + `<span class="p-family-name">Ride</span>`

## Status

**h-card** is a microformats.org draft specification. Public discussion on h-card takes place on the [#microformats channel on irc.freenode.net](/wiki/irc "irc") ([view recent discussions](https://chat.indieweb.org/microformats)), and specific issues [may be filed on GitHub](https://github.com/microformats/h-card/issues).

h-card is ready to use and implemented in the wild. For backwards compatibility you should also mark up top-level h-cards as classic [hCards](/wiki/hCard "hCard").

## Property Details

(stub, to be expanded)

### p-adr

`p-adr` can optionally embed an [h-adr](/wiki/h-adr "h-adr") to cluster associated structured address properties. E.g. adding "p-adr" to the example earlier:

```
<div class="h-card">
  <p class="p-name">Joe Bloggs</p>
  <p class="p-adr h-adr">
    <span class="p-street-address">17 Austerstræti</span>
    <span class="p-locality">Reykjavík</span>
    <span class="p-country-name">Iceland</span>
  </p>
</div>

```

Q: Why would you use "p-adr" to cluster associated structured address properties?

A: Because if you have more than one structured address, clustering which properties go with which address keeps them deterministically together, instead of depending on array indices or other heuristics.

### p-tel

Note: use of 'value' within 'p-tel' should be automatically handled by the support of the [value-class-pattern](/wiki/value-class-pattern "value-class-pattern"). And for now, the former [hCard](/wiki/hCard "hCard") 'type' subproperty of 'tel' is dropped/ignored. If there is demonstrable documented need for additional tel types (e.g. fax), we can introduce new flat properties as needed (e.g. p-tel-fax).

### dt-bday

Using truncated representations of dates for birth date is often good practice as noted in [the vcard spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350#section-4.3.1) eg

* `1985-04` for April 1985
* `1985` for the year 1985
* `--04-12` for April 12th with no specified year

### Reserved properties

The following properties were supported by the legacy hCard format, but were not carried over to h-card due to lack of real-world usage, or other problems. They are not part of h-card and should not be published, consumed, or proposed.

* **`p-organization-name`**
* **`p-organization-unit`**
* **`p-tz`** — timezone offset
  + it's going to be a hard one to "get right", as the way timezones work in vcard/ical is very weird, and timezones as a whole are an iffy thing to denote (quite the disconnect between complexity, automated processing ability, actually representing what a user would want to show/display or already does on their homepage, and actually representing something useful to parse and do something with)
  + there's certainly no ecosystem of publishers & consumers supporting p-tz in any meaningful interoperable way — [tantek in #microformats](https://chat.indieweb.org/microformats/2021-06-22/1624385751126500)
* **`dt-rev`**

* <https://pin13.net/> - enter a URL to a page to test where it says "Microformats Parser"

## Implementations

Software implementations that publish or consume h-card, including themes, plugins, or extensions:

(This section is a stub that needs expansion! In practice, nearly every CMS on every [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) site supports publishing h-card by default, and most sites which support receiving webmentions parse h-card for authorship data.)

When adding an implementation, please provide and link to its home page and open source repo if any.

* [GNUsocial](https://gnu.io/social/) [source code](https://git.gnu.io/gnu/gnu-social/)
* [Hubzilla](https://hubzilla.org/hubzilla/) [source code](https://github.org/redmatrix/hubzilla)
* [Friendica](http://friendica.com/) [source code](https://github.org/friendica/friendica)
* [InkBlot](https://github.com/dissolve/inkblot)
* [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io/) consumes h-card to show authorship information of feed posts ([source code](https://github.com/aaronpk/Aperture/))
* [XRay](https://xray.p3k.app/) consumes h-card and flattens it into a more minimal format ([source code](https://github.com/aaronpk/XRay/))
* [Known](https://withknown.com/) publishes and consumes h-card to show authorship of posts and responses
* [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) publishes microformats-2 versions of siloed content (including h-card for authorship) for consumption by mf2-consumers
* [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) consumes h-card for authorship data of incoming webmentions which it accepts on behalf of other sites
* ...
* ...

## Backward Compatibility

### Publisher Compatibility

For backward compatibility, you may wish to use classic [hCard](/wiki/hCard "hCard") classnames in addition to the more future-proof h-card properties, for example:

```
<p class="h-card vcard">
  <span class="p-name fn">Joe Bloggs</span>,
  <span class="p-org org">Awesome Nonprofit</span>
  ...
</p>

```

The class **`vcard`** is a *backward compatible root class name* that indicates the presence of an [hCard](/wiki/hCard "hCard").

**fn**, **org**, and all the other backward compatibility hCard property class names are listed below.

### Parser Compatibility

Microformats parsers *SHOULD* detect classic properties only if a classic root class name is found and parse them as microformats2 properties.

If an "h-card" is found, don't look for a "vcard" on the same element.

Compat. root class name: `vcard`  
Properties: (parsed as **p-** plain text unless otherwise specified)

* `fn` - parse as **`p-name`**
* `honorific-prefix`
* `given-name`
* `additional-name`
* `family-name`
* `honorific-suffix`
* `nickname`
* `email` - parse as **u-**
* `logo` - parse as **u-**
* `photo` - parse as **u-**
* `url` - parse as **u-**
* `uid` - parse as **u-**
* `category`
* `adr` - parse as **`p-adr h-adr`** including compat root class `adr`
* `extended-address`
* `street-address`
* `locality`
* `region`
* `postal-code`
* `country-name`
* `label`
* `geo` - parse as **`p-geo h-geo`** including compat root class `geo`
* `latitude`
* `longitude`
* `tel`
* `note`
* `bday` - parse as **dt-**
* `key` - parse as **u-**
* `org`
* `organization-name`
* `organization-unit`
* `title` - parse as **p-job-title**
* `role`

Reserved: (backward compat properties that parsers *MAY* implement, if they do, they *MUST* implement in this way:

* `tz`
* `rev` - parse as **dt-**

## Background

This work is based on the existing [hCard](/wiki/hCard "hCard") and [vcard](/wiki/vcard "vcard") specifications.

## Design Principles

(stub, expand)

## Additions

We've tried very hard with h-card to stay compatible with the vCard4 vocabulary, and thus additions should be proposed on the vCard4 mailing list.

However, you may still use this wiki to capture additions for h-card here:
