Webinars

[Chinese Students in Archives: Radical Empathy & Metadata

This webinar explores the representation of early Chinese international students at the University of Illinois, focusing on archival materials and metadata. Using the principle of radical empathy, the study identifies key issuesâ inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and inappropriatenessâaffecting discoverability and engagement. Introducing the âThree-I Framework,â the session highlights systemic factors shaping archival records and advocates for holistic, empathetic strategies beyond metadata enhancement to address subtle marginalization and improve access to these historical narratives.](https://www.dublincore.org/webinars/2025/metadata-chinese-students-archives/)

## Themes

The activities of DCMI, its members and its communities are broadly
characterised under four themes.

[Stewardship](/themes/stewardship/)
:   DCMI develops and curates open-standard metadata vocabularies such
    as the Dublin Core; hosts the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative
    (LRMI); and provides good-neighbor support for other related
    metadata activities.

[Community](/themes/community/)
:   DCMI's international community of metadata practitioners and experts
    meet in working groups and at an annual conference to share
    implementation experience and reports on research and new
    developments.

[Learning](/themes/learning/)
:   Teachers and experts of metadata technologies from around the world
    hold tutorials, online meetings, and webinars to discuss and
    disseminate innovative metadata solutions.

[Development](/themes/development/)
:   Since pioneering the Application Profile in the 1990s, DCMI
    continues to develop profiles and related vocabularies spanning
    practical techniques such as spreadsheets and modern technologies
    such as data shapes.
