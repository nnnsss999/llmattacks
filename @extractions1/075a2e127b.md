# h-event

From Microformats Wiki

[Jump to search](#searchInput)

h-event is a simple, open format for events on the web. h-event is often used with both event listings and individual event pages. h-event is one of several open [microformat](/wiki/microformats "microformats") draft standards suitable for embedding data in HTML.

h-event is the [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") update to [hCalendar](/wiki/hCalendar "hCalendar").

Status
:   This is a **Living Specification** yet mature enough to encourage additional implementations and [feedback](https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues).

Participate
:   [Open Issues](https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues)

## Example

Here is a simple event example:

```
<div class="h-event">
  <h1 class="p-name">Microformats Meetup</h1>
  <p>From 
    <time class="dt-start" datetime="2013-06-30 12:00">30<sup>th</sup> June 2013, 12:00</time>
    to <time class="dt-end" datetime="2013-06-30 18:00">18:00</time>
    at <span class="p-location">Some bar in SF</span></p>
  <p class="p-summary">Get together and discuss all things microformats-related.</p>
</div>

```

Parsed JSON:

```
{
  "items": [
    {
      "type": [
        "h-event"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "name": [
          "Microformats Meetup"
        ],
        "start": [
          "2013-06-30 12:00:00"
        ],
        "end": [
          "2013-06-30 18:00:00"
        ],
        "location": [
          "Some bar in SF"
        ],
        "summary": [
          "Get together and discuss all things microformats-related."
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

### Get started

The class **`h-event`** is a *root class name* that indicates the presence of an h-event.

**p-name**, **dt-start**, **dt-end**, **p-location**, **p-summary**, and the other h-event property class names listed below define *properties* of the h-event.

See [microformats2-parsing](/wiki/microformats2-parsing "microformats2-parsing") to learn more about property class names.

## Properties

h-event properties, inside an element with class **h-event**:

* **`p-name`** - event name (or title)
* **`p-summary`** - short summary of the event
* **`dt-start`** - datetime the event starts
* **`dt-end`** - datetime the event ends
* **`dt-duration`** - duration of the event
* **`p-description`** - more detailed description of the event
  + **WARNING:** Proposed to be replaced by **`e-content`** (re-used from [h-entry](/wiki/h-entry "h-entry"))
  + See and follow-up: <https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues/3>
* **`u-url`** - permalink for the event
* **`p-category`** - event category(ies)/tag(s)
* **`p-location`** - where the event takes place, optionally embedded [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card"), [h-adr](/wiki/h-adr "h-adr"), or [h-geo](/wiki/h-geo "h-geo")

All properties are optional.

### Experimental Properties

These properties are currently in use in the wild but not (yet) part of the draft h-event spec:

* **`p-attendee`** - a person attending the event, optionally embed [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card")

* This draft has not been updated in almost 2 years. During this period, `h-entry` `p-rsvp` has been standardised, thus making it robust and mature enough for the addition. I guess it's about time to unlabel `p-attendee` as experimental.
  + I've filed <https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues/2> to track advancing this draft as a whole. Let's do that with the existing draft before discussing p-attendee in particular. And rather than guessing, take a look at the vocabulary maturity levels in h-entry and perhaps help evaluate (in another issue) p-attendee according to those criteria. [Tantek](/wiki/User:Tantek "User:Tantek") 01:10, 28 February 2017 (UTC)
* I would also suggest to extend expected value to [h-entry](/wiki/h-entry "h-entry"), so that, while the personal info can be preserved, the attendee can also support p-rsvp property of h-entry.
  + I don't understand this. p-attendee is supposed to represent a person, e.g. an [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card"). How would it having that be an [h-entry](/wiki/h-entry "h-entry") make sense and work (from a publishing and consuming code perspective)? This proposed extension to p-attendee may be worth its own issue as well. [Tantek](/wiki/User:Tantek "User:Tantek") 01:10, 28 February 2017 (UTC)

* **`p-organizer`** - a person organizing an event, optionally embedded [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card"). Used in Indieweb events, but not consumed. <https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues/10>
* **`u-rsvp`** - similar to the proposed u-comment on h-entry, this would be the proposed property to mark up displayed RSVPs on an h-event. <https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues/9>

## Status

**h-event** is a microformats.org draft specification. Public discussion on h-event takes place on the [#microformats channel on irc.freenode.net](/wiki/irc "irc") ([view recent discussions](https://chat.indieweb.org/microformats)), and specific issues [may be filed on GitHub](https://github.com/microformats/h-event/issues).

h-event is ready to use and implemented in the wild. For backwards compatibility you should also mark up top-level h-events as classic [hCalendar](/wiki/hCalendar "hCalendar") events.

## Property Details

(stub, to be expanded)

### p-location

`p-location` is typically a physical address, optionally marked up with [h-adr](/wiki/h-adr "h-adr"), for example:

```
<p class="p-location h-adr">
  <span class="p-street-address">17 Austerstræti</span>
  <span class="p-locality">Reykjavík</span>
  <span class="p-country-name">Iceland</span>
</p>

```

### Reserved Properties

Reserved properties:

* **`p-organizer`** - a person (co-)organizing the event, optionally embed [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card")

  Main article: [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card")

  + proposed as way to [implement copying an event organizer to Eventbrite](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/275)

## Examples in the wild

Real world in the wild examples:

* ... add uses of h-event you see in the wild here.
* [W3Conf 2013](http://www.w3.org/conf/) uses h-event for the main event, and h-card for all the speakers and notable attendees. The h-cards make particularly good use of implied name, url, and photo properties.
* [Tantek Çelik](http://tantek.com/) uses h-event on his home page
* [microformats.org at 7 years](http://tantek.com/presentations/2012/06/microformats) presentation with h-event
* [Rise of the Indie Web hCards](http://tantek.com/presentations/2012/06/pdf2012-indieweb.html) (from Personal Democracy Forum 2012 #pdf12 #pdf2012) has [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") h-event and h-card markup
* WebMaker by Mozilla has h-event and h-card on event search (e.g. [search near Portland Oregon](https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/near/?lat=45.5234515&lng=-122.6762071)) and event pages (e.g. [IndieWebCamp 2012](https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/192f56eb9/)).[[1]](https://twitter.com/microformats/status/212207925643587585)
* [IndieWebCamp](http://indiewebcamp.com) has [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") h-event markup with embedded h-cards for the organizers and the location.
* [Mozilla Events](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Events) page has [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") h-event markup with attendees marked up with h-card.
* <https://gregorlove.com/events> has h-event markup, for example: <https://gregorlove.com/2017/06/homebrew-website-club/>
  + has additional property from [h-entry](/wiki/h-entry "h-entry"): `dt-published`
* <https://oauth.net/events/> has a list of h-event marked up events relating to OAuth, both future and past
* <http://68middle.st/events> has events marked up in h-event
* [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/exchange-of-calendar-events) mentions that iCalendar can be translated into h-event microformats in their "Exchange of calendar events" guidance.

> You can map events to and from iCalendar from other formats, such as h-event.

See [microformats2 examples in the wild](/wiki/microformats2#Examples_in_the_wild "microformats2") for more

## Validating

Main article: [validators](/wiki/validators "validators")

Test and validate [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") markup in general with:

* <https://pin13.net/mf2/> - enter your markup directly
* <https://pin13.net/> - enter a URL to a page to test where it says "Microformats Parser"

## Implementations

Software implementations that publish or consume h-event, including themes, plugins, or extensions:

When adding an implementation, please provide and link to its home page and open source repo if any.

* [mf2 to iCalendar](https://github.com/gRegorLove/mf2-to-iCalendar): Convert microformats h-event to iCalendar. Example: <https://gregorlove.com/calendar/>

## Backward Compatibility

### Publisher Compatibility

For backward compatibility, you may wish to use classic [hCalendar](/wiki/hCalendar "hCalendar") classnames in addition to the more future-proof h-event properties, for example:

```
<div class="h-event vevent">
  <h1 class="p-name summary">Some great event</h1>
</div>
</div>

```

### Parser Compatibility

Microformats parsers *SHOULD* detect classic properties only if a classic root class name is found and parse them as microformats2 properties.

If an "h-event" is found, don't look for a "vevent" on the same element.

Compat root class name: `vevent`  
Properties: (parsed as **p-** plain text unless otherwise specified)

* `summary` - parse as **`p-name`**
* `dtstart` - parse as **`dt-start`**
* `dtend` - parse as **`dt-end`**
* `duration` - parse as **`dt-duration`**
* `description`
* `url` - parse as **u-**
* `category`
* `location` - including compat root `vcard` in the absence of `h-card`, and compat root `adr` in the absence of `h-adr`
* `geo` - parse as **`p-location h-geo`** including compat root `geo`

### iCalendar Compatibility

hCalendar-specific implementations that perform custom display or translation to iCalendar .ics *SHOULD* prefer `p-name` over `p-summary`, and use `p-summary` value(s) as a fallback if there is no `p-name`.

## Background

This work is based on the existing [hCalendar](/wiki/hCalendar "hCalendar") and [iCalendar](/wiki/iCalendar "iCalendar") specifications.

## Design Principles
