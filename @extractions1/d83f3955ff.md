> Abstract:Prompt injection has emerged as a serious security threat to large language models (LLMs). At present, the current best-practice for defending against newly-discovered prompt injection techniques is to add additional guardrails to the system (e.g., by updating the system prompt or using classifiers on the input and/or output of the model.) However, in the same way that variants of a piece of malware are created to evade anti-virus software, variants of a prompt injection can be created to evade the LLM's guardrails. Ideally, when a new prompt injection technique is discovered, candidate defenses should be tested not only against the successful prompt injection, but also against possible variants.
>   
> In this work, we present, a tool to assist defenders in performing automated variant analysis of known prompt injection attacks. This involves solving two main challenges: (1) automatically generating variants of a given prompt according, and (2) automatically determining whether a variant was effective based only on the output of the model. This tool can also assist in generating datasets for jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, thus overcoming the scarcity of data in this domain.
>   
> We evaluate Maatphor on three different types of prompt injection tasks. Starting from an ineffective (0%) seed prompt, Maatphor consistently generates variants that are at least 60% effective within the first 40 iterations.
