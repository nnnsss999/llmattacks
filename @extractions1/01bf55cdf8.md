# h-entry

From Microformats Wiki

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)

h-entry is a simple, open format for content on the web. h-entry is often used with content intended to be syndicated, e.g. blog posts. h-entry is one of several open [microformat](/wiki/microformats "microformats") standards suitable for embedding data in HTML.

h-entry is the [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") update to [hAtom](/wiki/hAtom "hAtom"), in particular its "hentry" root class which itself was based on [Atom](/wiki/Atom "Atom")'s "entry" element. For an update to "hfeed" see [h-feed](/wiki/h-feed "h-feed").

Status
:   This is a **Living Specification** yet mature enough to encourage additional implementations and [feedback](/wiki/h-entry-issues "h-entry-issues"). This specification has portions that are stable, draft, and proposed. Features are stable unless explicitly labeled draft or proposed, or in draft or proposed sections. Draft and proposed features are likely to change substantively. While substantive changes to stable features are unexpected, it is a living specification subject to substantive change by issues and errata filed in response to implementation experience, requiring consensus among participating implementers as part of an explicit [change control](#change_control) process.

## Get started

The class **`h-entry`** is a *root class name* that indicates the presence of an h-entry.

**p-name**, **p-author**, **dt-published** and the other h-entry property classnames listed below define properties of the h-entry.

Note: The purpose of an entry is to place it around both the explicitly written content (in the content property or in other specific properties for non-textual content or responses) and whatever else is the context for that content, including properties for when it was published and/or updated, who created it, tags or categorization, and links to what the content is a response to (perhaps with a quoted excerpt) and/or links to syndicated copies.

## Properties

h-entry properties, inside an element with class **h-entry**. All properties are both optional and may have multiple instances, e.g. multiple name, url, photo etc. properties.

* See [microformats2-parsing](/wiki/microformats2-parsing "microformats2-parsing") to learn more about property classnames.

### Core Properties

The following *core* h-entry properties have broad consensus and are broadly interoperably published and consumed:

* **`p-name`** - entry name/title
* **`p-summary`** - short entry summary
* **`e-content`** - full content of the entry
* **`dt-published`** - when the entry was published
* **`dt-updated`** - when the entry was updated
* **`p-author`** - who wrote the entry, optionally embedded [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card")(s)
* **`p-category`** - entry categories/tags
* **`u-url`** - entry permalink URL
* **`u-uid`** - universally unique identifier, typically canonical entry URL
* **`p-location`** - location the entry was posted from, optionally embed [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card"), [h-adr](/wiki/h-adr "h-adr"), or [h-geo](/wiki/h-geo "h-geo")
* **`u-syndication`** - URL(s) of syndicated copies of this post. The property equivalent of [rel-syndication](/wiki/rel-syndication "rel-syndication") ([example](http://erinjo.is/2014/checked-into-rockit-colabs-23))
* **`u-in-reply-to`** - the URL which the h-entry is considered reply to (i.e. doesn’t make sense without context, could show up in comment thread), optionally an embedded [h-cite](/wiki/h-cite "h-cite") ([reply-context](http://indiewebcamp.com/reply-context)) ([example](https://kartikprabhu.com/notes/re-citizen-of-indieweb))
* **`p-rsvp`** (enum, use <data> element or [value-class-pattern](/wiki/value-class-pattern "value-class-pattern"))
  + "yes", "no", "maybe", "interested". Case-insensitive values, normalized to lowercase. Examples:
  + `... <data class="p-rsvp" value="YES">is going</data> to ...`, or
  + `... <data class="p-rsvp" value="Maybe">might go</data> to ...`
  + `... <data class="p-rsvp" value="no">unable to go</data> to ...`
  + `... <data class="p-rsvp" value="interested">am interested/tracking/watching</data> ...`
* **`u-like-of`** - the URL which the h-entry is considered a “like” (favorite, star) of. Optionally an embedded [h-cite](/wiki/h-cite "h-cite")
* **`u-repost-of`** - the URL which the h-entry is considered a “repost” of. Optionally an embedded [h-cite](/wiki/h-cite "h-cite").

### Draft Properties

The following draft properties are in use in the wild (published and consumed), and are under strong consideration, but are not yet part of the core:

* **`p-comment`** - optionally embedded (or nested?) [h-cite](/wiki/h-cite "h-cite")(s), each of which is a comment on/reply to the parent h-entry. See [comment-brainstorming](/wiki/comment-brainstorming "comment-brainstorming") ([example](http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4V2DjG/))
  + [Issue 20](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/20)
* **`u-photo`** - one or more photos that is/are considered the primary content of the entry, unless there is a `p-location h-card`, which is still considered a "checkin" (i.e. with a photo). Otherwise the presence of a u-photo means the name of the entry should be interpreted as a caption on the photo, and the summary/content should be interpreted as a description of the photo.
  + [Issue 4: u-photo draft->core bc way more than 3+ pub and consuming impls/sites](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/4)
    - depends on: [Issue 24: Update Definition of Draft Property u-photo](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/24)
    - depends on: [Issue 23: E-Content Overlaps with u-photo and similar properties](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/23)
  + Proposed (issue TBF): A `u-photo` property MUST be on an element that provides a text description for the image (e.g. `<img alt="">`) UNLESS the image is already described inside the contents a text property such as `p-name`, `p-summary`, or `e-content`
* **`u-video`** - special u- parsing rules for `<video src> & <source src>`
  + [Issue 5](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/5)

### Proposed Additions

The following properties are proposed additions based on various use-cases, such as existing [link preview](/wiki/link-preview-brainstorming "link-preview-brainstorming") markup conventions, but are awaiting citations of use across multiple sites in the wild, and at least one reader / real world consuming code example:

* **`u-audio`** - special u- parsing rules for `<audio src> & <source src>`. Examples: [Transportini](http://transportini.com/),[possibly more](https://indieweb.org/podcast#How_to_podcast_with_h-feed)
  + [Issue 6](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/6)
* **`u-like`** - similar to p-comment, URL to a like post of the current post, e.g. in a responses list or facepile.
  + [Issue 32](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/31)
* **`u-repost`** - similar to u-like, URL to a repost of the current post, e.g. in a responses list or facepile.
  + [Issue 30](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/30)
* **`u-bookmark-of`** - indicates this h-entry is a bookmark of another URL. Optionally an [h-cite](/wiki/h-cite "h-cite"). See [indieweb.org/bookmark](https://indieweb.org/bookmark) for examples in the wild.
  + [Issue 12](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/12)
* **`u-featured`** - a representative photo or image for the entry, e.g. primary photo for an article or subject-cropped photo, suitable for use in a [link-preview](/wiki/link-preview "link-preview").
  + +1 sknebel: <https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/14>
* Location Properties - <https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/29>
  + **`p-latitude`** - latitude of the location of the entry
  + **`p-longitude`** - longitude of the location of the entry
  + **`p-altitude`** - altitude of the location of the entry
* **`p-duration`** - duration of an audio or video file in the entry. <https://indieweb.org/duration> Multiple publishers and consumers in the wild; <https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/169> more background.
  + [Issue 21](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/21)
* **`p-size`** - size in bytes of an audio or video file in the entry. <https://indieweb.org/size> Multiple publishers and consumers in the wild; <https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/169> more background.
* **`u-listen-of`** - also known as a 'scrobble', indicates this h-entry is a listen of another URL. Optionally an h-cite. <https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/11>
* **`u-watch-of`** - indicates this h-entry is a watch of another URL, a visual version of the scrobble. Optionally an h-cite. <https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/17>
* **`p-read-of`** - indicates this h-entry is a read post of some written work (book or other document). The value can be the title of the work or an h-cite. Proposal also mentions `u-read-of`, where the value would be a URL to the written work or a representative citation page. <https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/10>
* **`u-translation-of`** - indicates this h-entry is a translation of the linked URL into another language. Can be used in the same way as the existing `u-like-of` and `u-repost-of` properties, with just the URL to the original h-entry, or (optionally) contain an embedded `h-cite`. <https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/26>
* **`u-checkin`** - the URL of the venue/location h-card which the h-entry is considered a “checkin” of. Optionally an embedded h-card. <https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/15>
* **`u-review-of`** - the URL which the h-entry is considered a review of, optionally an embedded h-cite, h-card, h-event, or h-item. This could allow retirement of the h-review as unnecessary, in theory.
  + [Issue 32](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/32)

The following interpretation is also proposed addition:

* if the `p-location` is also an embedded [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card"), the entry is treated as a "checkin".
  + -1 [Aaronpk](/wiki/User:Aaronpk "User:Aaronpk") 14:22, 19 January 2017 (UTC) [this post](https://aaronparecki.com/2017/01/13/21/) is not a checkin, but has an h-card as the p-location property.

Note: As h-entry usage grows to express and consume different kinds of content, we expect additional properties may be proposed and iterated as demonstrated by real-world needs, usage, and interoperability.

### Proposing and upgrading

How do you add proposed properties and then upgrade them to draft and then core properties?

See: [change control](/wiki/h-entry#change_control "h-entry")

## Property Details

This section is a stub.

### p-location

**`p-location`** has been re-used from [h-event](/wiki/h-event "h-event").

## FAQ

### p-name of a note

* **What is the `p-name` of a [note](https://indieweb.org/note)?**
  + You probably should avoid adding `p-name` to notes. See <https://indieweb.org/note> for more discussion of the topic.

### venue an entry was posted from

* **How do you indicate a named venue where an entry was posted from? Like a restaurant or park.**
  + Use an embedded [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card") microformat on a `p-location` property value.

### address an entry was posted from

* **How do you indicate the address where an entry was posted from? Like a restaurant or park.**
  + If the address is just part of a named venue, see above, use an [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card")
  + Otherwise use an embedded [h-adr](/wiki/h-adr "h-adr") microformat on a `p-location` property value.

### lat long an entry was posted from

* **How do you indicate the latitude and longitude of where an entry was posted from?**
  + If the location has a name in addition to latitude and longitude, see above, use an [h-card](/wiki/h-card "h-card")
  + Otherwise if there is an address in addition to latitude and longitude, see above, use an [h-adr](/wiki/h-adr "h-adr")
  + Otherwise use an embedded [h-geo](/wiki/h-geo "h-geo") microformat on a `p-location` property value.

### dt-published property and HTML5 time element

* **Does the dt-published property need to be a time element?**
  + The `dt-published` property should be a `<time>` element so that you can take advantage of HTML5's "datetime" property.
  + This lets you specify a human-readable date in the value of the attribute, and the ISO8601 machine-readable date in the "datetime" property.

### what is the bare minimum list of required properties on an h-entry

What is the bare minimum list of required properties on an h-entry?
:   No properties are explicitly required, but in practice a h-entry should have the following properties at a minimum for consumers:

    * `url`
    * `published` — if there is no "published" date for the "entry", then reconsider whether it is correct (or worth) marking it up as an entry.

What properties should an h-entry have in addition to the bare minimum?
:   Beyond the bare minimum, a typical h-entry should have the following as well:

    * `content` (or `summary` at least) - especially for structured content. For a plain text note, the content/summary (whichever is used) should be the same as the `name`, otherwise it will be implied from the text content of the root element.
    * `name` - for explicitly named/titled entries like blog posts and articles. Otherwise the entry is assumed to be a "title-less" [note](https://indieweb.org/note) (like a tweet).
    * `author` - including a nested `h-card` with author details like name, photo, url.

For backward compatibility with legacy [hAtom](/wiki/hAtom "hAtom") consuming implementations, use [hAtom](/wiki/hAtom "hAtom") classnames (or rel values) in addition to the more future-proof h-entry properties, for example:

```
<article class="h-entry hentry">
  <h1 class="p-name entry-title">A Tale Of Two Tags</h1>
  <address class="p-author author h-card vcard">
    <a href="https://chandra.example.com/" class="u-url url p-name fn" rel="author">Chandra</a>
  </address>
  <time class="dt-published published" datetime="2012-06-20T08:34:46-07:00">June 20, 2012</time>
  <div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>It was the best of visible tags, it was the alternative invisible tags.</p>
    <p>The a tag is perhaps the best of HTML, yet its corresponding invisible link tag has uses too.</p>
  </div>
  <a href="/category/uncategorized/" rel="category tag" class="p-category">General</a>
</article>

```

ℹ️ Note: Note: you may use any valid HTML5 elements. The `article h1 address time` elements are used in the example as semantically richer suggestions, however in general `div span` work fine too. The `time` element is special though in that its `datetime` attribute provides a more author/user friendly way of separating a machine readable ISO8601 datetime from a human readable summary.

The list of equivalent [hAtom](/wiki/hAtom "hAtom") classnames and rel values is provided below.

### Parser Compatibility

Microformats parsers *SHOULD* detect classic properties only if a classic root class name is found and parse them as microformats2 properties.

If an "h-entry" is found, don't look for an "hentry" on the same element.

Compat root class name: `hentry`  
Properties: (parsed as **p-** plain text unless otherwise specified):

* `entry-title` - parse as **`p-name`**
* `entry-summary` - parse as **`p-summary`**
* `entry-content` - parse as **`e-content`**
* `published` - parse as **dt-**
* `updated` - parse as **dt-**
* `author` - including compat root `vcard` in the absence of `h-card`
* `category`
* `rel=bookmark` - parse as **`u-url`**. While not a class name nor typical microformats property, rel=bookmark was the only way to indicate an hentry permalink. Thus parsers should look for rel=bookmark hyperlinks inside an hentry, and take their "href" value as a value for a **`u-url`** property, including handling any relative URL resolution.
* `rel=tag` - parse as **`p-category`**. While not a class name nor typical microformats property, rel=tag was the typical way to tag an hentry. Thus parsers should look for rel=tag hyperlinks inside an hentry, and take the last path segment of their "href" value as a value for a **`p-category`** property.

Proposed: ([follow-up in issue #7](https://github.com/microformats/h-entry/issues/7))

* `time.entry-date[datetime]` - in the absence of `published`, parse as **`dt-published`**. parse for the first `<time>` element with class name of `entry-date` and non-empty `datetime` attribute inside an hentry, if there is no `published` property, use that time element's `datetime` attribute value for the `dt-published` property. Evidence: default WordPress themes 2011-2014([[1]](https://wp-themes.com/twentyeleven/)[[2]](https://wp-themes.com/twentytwelve/)[[3]](https://wp-themes.com/twentythirteen/)[[4]](https://wp-themes.com/twentyfourteen/)).
* `rel=author` - in the absence of `author`, parse as **`u-author`**. While not a class name nor typical microformats property, rel=author was commonly used to link to an author's URL. Thus parsers should look for rel=author hyperlinks inside an hentry (or even on the same page, preceding the hentry), use the absolute version of it as a value for the **`u-author`** property if there is no "author" property. (citations to "hentry" examples in the wild that *depend* on rel=author needed to accepted this proposal. Note: default WordPress themes twentyeleven, twentytwelve, twentythirteen, twentyfourteen all use rel=author but only inside class="author vcard", and thus rel=author can be ignored since authorship is already picked up by existing `author` backcompat parsing.)

### Compat FAQ

#### What about rel bookmark

Also asked as: *Why use an h-entry u-url u-uid for permalinks when I have [rel=bookmark](/wiki/rel-bookmark "rel-bookmark")?*

A: tl;dr: use `class="u-url u-uid"` instead of `rel=bookmark` for post permalinks because it's simpler (fewer attributes), and works better across contexts (permalink page, recent posts on home page, collection of posts on archive pages).

rel=bookmark was the old [hAtom](/wiki/hAtom "hAtom") way of marking up permalinks. Since then two factors have contributed to reducing use of rel inside microformats:

* rel by typically\* document scoped in [HTML5](/wiki/HTML5 "HTML5") - thus making it inappropriate for use in microformats that are aggregated, e.g. a collection of posts on a home page or in monthly archives.
* it is easier to always use class names for properties. When formats use two (or more!) attributes in HTML to specify properties, confusion results in lower data quality (of the markup and thus the stuff that is marked up). Thus per the microformats [principle](/wiki/principle "principle") of [simplicity](/wiki/simplicity "simplicity"), in [microformats2](/wiki/microformats2 "microformats2") we only use class names for properties.

\* even though rel=bookmark in particular is article-element / sectioning scoped in HTML5[[5]](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/links.html#link-type-bookmark), it's a detail that typical authors are not going to remember, and thus it's not good to depend on it for any kind of format.

#### Why rename entry-title entry-summary entry-content

The `entry-*` classnames in classic [hAtom](/wiki/hAtom "hAtom") were prefixed as such due to concerns about vocabulary overlap with the title (as in job title, completely separate semantic) property in [hCard](/wiki/hCard "hCard") and the summary property in [hCalendar](/wiki/hCalendar "hCalendar") (see: [hAtom FAQ](/wiki/hatom-faq#Could_hAtom_instead_use_title_content_and_summary "hatom-faq")).

Following the [simplicity](/wiki/simplicity "simplicity") principle, in microformats2, the aforementioned vagueness of **title** is dealt with by removing it. As **name** is now used consistently across all vocabularies as the property which “names” the microformat, it makes sense to use it to mark up the name of a post.

Likewise, adding entry- to **summary** doesn’t add any useful information, and in practice there have been no problems with blog post summaries overlapping with entry summaries, so it makes sense to simplify to **summary**. The same applies to **entry-content** simplified to **content**.

## Related Work

Work that re-uses or builds upon h-entry:

* [Mailpile Open Message Format](https://mailpile.pagekite.me:8080/p/Open_Message_Format) is using h-entry with structured properties, e.g. p-author h-card.

## Background

This work is based on the existing [hAtom](/wiki/hAtom "hAtom") microformat, and extensive selfdogfooding in the [indie web camp](http://indiewebcamp.com) community.

## change control

Minor editorial changes (e.g. fixing minor typos or punctuation) that do not change and preferably clarify the structure and existing intended meaning may be done by anyone without filing issues, requiring only a sufficient "Summary" description field entry for the edit. More than minor but still purely editorial changes may be made by an editor. Anyone may question such editorial changes by undoing corresponding edits without filing an issue. Any further reversion or iteration on such an editorial change must be done by filing an issue.

For the stable features of this document, substantive issue filing, resolution, and edits may be done by filing an [issue](/wiki/h-entry-issues "h-entry-issues") and discussing them on the issue and on #microformats [IRC](/wiki/IRC "IRC") with a link to the issue.

Because this is primarily a vocabulary specification, very few issues beyond the list of vocabulary have been filed or required any lengthy discussion. If such a non-trivial issue arises in the future, use the [microformats2-parsing change control process](/wiki/microformats2-parsing#change_control "microformats2-parsing") to resolve them.

In general, non-vocabulary related features or requirements should be avoided in this specification, e.g. changes to microformats2 syntax must be proposed as [microformats2-parsing](/wiki/microformats2-parsing "microformats2-parsing") changes using the [microformats2-parsing change control process](/wiki/microformats2-parsing#change_control "microformats2-parsing").

Beyond that, the following requirements must be met for adding or moving features (e.g. properties and values) to proposed, draft, or stable. File an issue to collect necessary citations for the requirements for each property being proposed or upgraded, explain how citations fulfill the requirements for the phase(s), get consensus on both (resolve any implementer objections) in the issue.

Proposed
:   [Proposed features](#Proposed_Additions) must provide documentation of what specific real world use-cases they are solving, preferably with a link to a step-by-step user scenario, e.g. demonstratable using existing non-standard / single-site / single-implementation tools.

Draft
:   [Draft properties](#Draft_Properties) must in addition be published and consumed in the wild on the public web, demonstrate solving the use case for which they were proposed, and should provide citations of real world public web sites publishing and (other sites) consuming them, interoperably.

Stable
:   Stable features (e.g. [Core Properties](#Core_Properties)) must in addition be published and consumed in the wild on multiple sites by multiple implementations (3+ different sites and implementations for publishing and consuming). When a draft property reaches a critical mass of deployment by numerous sites and implementations (far beyond 3+), due to network effects and backward compatibility considerations it effectively becomes stable, since it becomes increasingly difficult to change it in any way and have so many sites and implementations also change.

For creating an entirely new vocabulary, and more details about how to research existing values, properties, document examples in the wild, etc., see the microformats [process](/wiki/process "process").
