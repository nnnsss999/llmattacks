**Glossary:**

This document follows the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM] in its use of the following terminology:

*term*
:   A property (element), class, vocabulary encoding scheme, or syntax encoding scheme.

*URI*
:   A Uniform Resource Identifier [[URI](#URI)] or Internationalized Resource Identifier [[IRI](#IRI)].

In addition, this document uses the following terminology:

*DCMI term*
:   A *term* that is declared and maintained by DCMI.

*term URI*
:   The *URI* that identifies a *term*.

*DCMI term URI*
:   The *URI* for a *term* that is declared and managed by DCMI.

*term name*
:   A unique token assigned to a *term*. For all *DCMI terms*, the *term name* is appended to a *DCMI namespace URI* to create the *DCMI term URI*.

*term label*
:   A human-readable label assigned to a *term*.

*DCMI namespace*
:   A collection of *DCMI term URIs* where each *term* is assigned a *URI* that starts with the same 'base URI'. The 'base URI' is known as the *DCMI namespace URI*. (Note that a *DCMI namespace* is not the same as an 'XML namespace').

*DCMI namespace URI*
:   The *URI* that identifies a *DCMI namespace*.

*DCMI recommendation*
:   A specification, approved through DCMI's formal process, which may define one or more *DCMI terms*.

*DCMI term declaration*
:   A representation of one or more *DCMI terms*.

*Term URIs* are grouped into *DCMI namespaces* in order to ease the assignment of *URIs* to *terms* and to streamline their use in particular encoding syntaxes. Note that the grouping of *term URIs* into *DCMI namespaces* is orthogonal to the grouping of *terms* into sets designed to meet other functional needs, e.g., as various types of vocabularies.

## 1. Introduction

All *terms* used in metadata descriptions that conform to the DCMI Abstract Model [DCAM] must be assigned a unique *URI*. For convenience, the *term URIs* that are assigned and managed by the DCMI are grouped into collections known as *DCMI namespaces*. This document describes how *term URIs* are allocated by DCMI and the policies associated with *DCMI namespaces*.

## 2. DCMI Namespace URIs

The *DCMI namespace URI* for the collection of all DCMI properties, classes and encoding schemes (other than the properties in the Dublin Coreâ¢ Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 [DCMES], the classes in the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE] and the *terms* used in the DCMI Abstract Model) is:

```

http://purl.org/dc/terms/

```

The *DCMI namespace URI* for the collection of *classes* in the DCMI Type Vocabulary [DCMI-TYPE] is:

```

http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/

```

The *DCMI namespace URI* for the collection of *DCMI terms* used in the DCMI Abstract Model is:

```

http://purl.org/dc/dcam/

```

The *DCMI namespace URI* for the collection of legacy properties that make up the Dublin Coreâ¢ Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 [DCMES] is:

```

http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/

```

Therefore, the four currently approved DCMI namespace URIs are:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| http://purl.org/dc/terms/ | All DCMI properties, classes and encoding schemes (unless indicated below) |
| http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/ | Classes in the DCMI Type Vocabulary |
| http://purl.org/dc/dcam/ | Terms used in the DCMI Abstract Model |
| http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ | The Dublin Core™ Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1 (original 15 elements) |

All future *DCMI namespace URIs* (additional DCMI controlled vocabularies for example) will conform to this pattern:

```

http://purl.org/dc/namespace_label/

```

All *DCMI namespace URIs* will dereference to a *DCMI term declaration* for all the *terms* with *term URIs* within that *DCMI namespace*. A machine-processable *DCMI term declaration* will be made available.

Some example *DCMI term URIs* follow:

```

http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent

```

is the *DCMI term URI* for the Extent *property*.

```

http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image

```

is the *DCMI term URI* for the Image *class* in the DCMI Type Vocabulary.

```

http://purl.org/dc/dcam/VocabularyEncodingScheme
```

is the *DCMI term URI* for *Vocabulary Encoding Scheme* class in the DCMI Abstract Model, and

```

http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title

```

is the *DCMI term URI* for the Title *property* in the Dublin Coreâ¢ Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1.

Each *DCMI term* can be so identified.

All *DCMI term URIs* will dereference to a *DCMI term declaration* for the identified *term*. A machine-processable *DCMI term declaration* will be made available.

## 3. Policy concerning classes of changes to DCMI terms

Changes to *DCMI terms* or *term declarations* will occur from time to time for a variety of reasons. Such changes have varying implications for *DCMI term URIs* and *DCMI namespaces*. The following classes of changes are identified along with examples and associated implications.

In all cases, any changes to *DCMI terms* or *term declarations* will result in an update to the versioning information carried in the *DCMI recommendation* and/or *DCMI term declaration* associated with that *term*.

### A. Minor editorial errata

Errors of spelling, punctuation, or other clerical mistakes discovered in *DCMI recommendations* and/or *DCMI term declarations* will be corrected without a comment period, following notification to the DCMI Usage Board [DCMI-USAGE], as long as, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, there are no implications for negative impact on users or applications that rely on those *DCMI term declarations*.

Correction of minor editorial errata will result in no changes to *DCMI term URIs*.

### B. Substantive editorial errata

Errors of substance discovered in *DCMI recommendations* and/or *DCMI term declarations* will trigger public notification of the correction to the DC-General mailing list [DC-GENERAL]. Errors that, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, compromise the immediate usefulness or accuracy of DCMI metadata systems will be corrected immediately (for example, an incorrect URL to a resource external to DCMI). Others will be corrected following a 14-day public comment period to assure that changes do not adversely effect systems or applications which rely on the *DCMI namespace* infrastructure.

Correction of substantive editorial errata will result in no changes in *DCMI term URIs*.

### C. Semantic changes in DCMI terms

Changes of definitions within *DCMI recommendations* and/or *DCMI term declarations* will be reflected in the affected *DCMI recommendation* and/or *DCMI term declaration*. If, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, such changes of meaning are likely to have substantial impact on either machine processing of *DCMI terms* or the functional semantics of the *terms*, then these changes will be reflected in a change of URI for the *DCMI term* or *terms* in question. The URIs for any new *DCMI namespaces* resulting from such changes will conform to the *DCMI namespace URI* pattern defined above.

D. Addition of DCMI term declarations to existing DCMI namespaces

New *DCMI term URIs* will occasionally be added to existing *DCMI namespaces*. Addition of *DCMI term URIs* to existing *DCMI namespaces* will not trigger changes in *DCMI namespace URIs*.

## 4. Persistence Policy

DCMI recognizes that people and applications depend on the persistence of formal documents and machine processable schemas that have been made publicly available. In particular, the stability of *DCMI term URIs* and *DCMI namespace URIs* is critical to interoperability over time. Thus, the wide promulgation of this set of *URIs* dictates that they be maintained to support legacy applications that have adopted them.

## 5. Justification

Two significant suggestions were made during the development of this policy in 2001. Firstly, it was suggested that *DCMI namespace URIs* indicate the category of *DCMI terms* associated with that namespace. For example, it was proposed that different *DCMI namespaces* might be used to partition DCMI properties from DCMI encoding schemes, or to indicate that a particular *term* was originally defined by a particular community or within a particular domain. Secondly, that all *DCMI namespace URIs* carry versioning information (for example a date stamp) that would be updated as terms within the namespace change.

On the first issue it was considered that the category of *DCMI terms* is not necessarily persistent. For example, *terms* defined initially by the education community might subsequently become useful to other communities. Associating particular URIs with particular categories of *terms* was not felt to be helpful to the long-term stability of *DCMI namespaces* or the URIs of *DCMI terms* within those namespaces.

On the second issue it was again considered that embedding versioning information within the *DCMI namespace URI* was unlikely to be helpful to the long-term stability of *DCMI namespace URIs* or *DCMI term URIs* within those *DCMI namespaces*. Rather, it was felt that versioning information should be carried within the *DCMI recommendations* and/or *DCMI term declarations* associated with *DCMI namespaces* and *terms*.
