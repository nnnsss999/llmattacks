Unregistered or niche encoding and file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry. Supersedes [fileFormat](/fileFormat "fileFormat"). |

| `headline` | [Text](/Text "Text") | Headline of the article. |
| `inLanguage` | [Language](/Language "Language")  or   [Text](/Text "Text") | The language of the content or performance or used in an action. Please use one of the language codes from the [IETF BCP 47 standard](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). See also [availableLanguage](/availableLanguage). Supersedes [language](/language "language"). |
| `interactionStatistic` | [InteractionCounter](/InteractionCounter "InteractionCounter") | The number of interactions for the CreativeWork using the WebSite or SoftwareApplication. The most specific child type of InteractionCounter should be used. Supersedes [interactionCount](/interactionCount "interactionCount"). |

A maintainer is a [Person](/Person) or [Organization](/Organization) that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources. When [maintainer](/maintainer) is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [Dataset](/Dataset), it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [isBasedOn](/isBasedOn) property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work. |
| `material` | [Product](/Product "Product")  or   [Text](/Text "Text")  or   [URL](/URL "URL") | A material that something is made from, e.g. leather, wool, cotton, paper. |

Use [businessFunction](/businessFunction) to indicate the kind of transaction offered, i.e. sell, lease, etc. This property can also be used to describe a [Demand](/Demand). While this property is listed as expected on a number of common types, it can be used in others. In that case, using a second type, such as Product or a subtype of Product, can clarify the nature of the offer.  Inverse property: [itemOffered](/itemOffered "itemOffered") |
| `pattern` | [DefinedTerm](/DefinedTerm "DefinedTerm")  or   [Text](/Text "Text") | A pattern that something has, for example 'polka dot', 'striped', 'Canadian flag'. Values are typically expressed as text, although links to controlled value schemes are also supported. |

When applied to a [CreativeWork](/CreativeWork) (e.g. [NewsArticle](/NewsArticle)) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the [CreativeWork](/CreativeWork).   While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a [funder](/funder)) can be expressed using schema.org terminology. |
| `recordedAt` | [Event](/Event "Event") | The Event where the CreativeWork was recorded. The CreativeWork may capture all or part of the event.  Inverse property: [recordedIn](/recordedIn "recordedIn") |
| `releasedEvent` | [PublicationEvent](/PublicationEvent "PublicationEvent") | The place and time the release was issued, expressed as a PublicationEvent. |
| `review` | [Review](/Review "Review") | A review of the item. Supersedes [reviews](/reviews "reviews"). |
| `schemaVersion` | [Text](/Text "Text")  or   [URL](/URL "URL") | Indicates (by URL or string) a particular version of a schema used in some CreativeWork. This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. `10.0` as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, `https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0`. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. `http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/` but this has not been carefully explored in the community. |
| `sdDatePublished` | [Date](/Date "Date") | Indicates the date on which the current structured data was generated / published. Typically used alongside [sdPublisher](/sdPublisher). |
| `sdLicense` | [CreativeWork](/CreativeWork "CreativeWork")  or   [URL](/URL "URL") | A license document that applies to this structured data, typically indicated by URL. |
| `sdPublisher` | [Organization](/Organization "Organization")  or   [Person](/Person "Person") | Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The [sdPublisher](/sdPublisher) property helps make such practices more explicit. |
| `size` | [DefinedTerm](/DefinedTerm "DefinedTerm")  or   [QuantitativeValue](/QuantitativeValue "QuantitativeValue")  or   [SizeSpecification](/SizeSpecification "SizeSpecification")  or   [Text](/Text "Text") | A standardized size of a product or creative work, specified either through a simple textual string (for example 'XL', '32Wx34L'), a QuantitativeValue with a unitCode, or a comprehensive and structured [SizeSpecification](/SizeSpecification); in other cases, the [width](/width), [height](/height), [depth](/depth) and [weight](/weight) properties may be more applicable. |
| `sourceOrganization` | [Organization](/Organization "Organization") | The Organization on whose behalf the creator was working. |
| `spatial` | [Place](/Place "Place") | The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific properties (e.g. [locationCreated](/locationCreated), [spatialCoverage](/spatialCoverage), [contentLocation](/contentLocation)) are not known to be appropriate. |
| `spatialCoverage` | [Place](/Place "Place") | The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York. |
| `sponsor` | [Organization](/Organization "Organization")  or   [Person](/Person "Person") | A person or organization that supports a thing through a pledge, promise, or financial contribution. E.g. a sponsor of a Medical Study or a corporate sponsor of an event. |
| `teaches` | [DefinedTerm](/DefinedTerm "DefinedTerm")  or   [Text](/Text "Text") | The item being described is intended to help a person learn the competency or learning outcome defined by the referenced term. |
| `temporal` | [DateTime](/DateTime "DateTime")  or   [Text](/Text "Text") | The "temporal" property can be used in cases where more specific properties (e.g. [temporalCoverage](/temporalCoverage), [dateCreated](/dateCreated), [dateModified](/dateModified), [datePublished](/datePublished)) are not known to be appropriate. |
| `temporalCoverage` | [DateTime](/DateTime "DateTime")  or   [Text](/Text "Text")  or   [URL](/URL "URL") | The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in [ISO 8601 time interval format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals). In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".   Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes [datasetTimeInterval](/datasetTimeInterval "datasetTimeInterval"). |
| `text` | [Text](/Text "Text") | The textual content of this CreativeWork. |
| `thumbnail` | [ImageObject](/ImageObject "ImageObject") | Thumbnail image for an image or video. |

| `translationOfWork` | [CreativeWork](/CreativeWork "CreativeWork") | The work that this work has been translated from. E.g. ç©ç§èµ·æº is a translationOf âOn the Origin of Speciesâ.  Inverse property: [workTranslation](/workTranslation "workTranslation") |
| `translator` | [Organization](/Organization "Organization")  or   [Person](/Person "Person") | Organization or person who adapts a creative work to different languages, regional differences and technical requirements of a target market, or that translates during some event. |
| `typicalAgeRange` | [Text](/Text "Text") | The typical expected age range, e.g. '7-9', '11-'. |
| `usageInfo` | [CreativeWork](/CreativeWork "CreativeWork")  or   [URL](/URL "URL") | The schema.org [usageInfo](/usageInfo) property indicates further information about a [CreativeWork](/CreativeWork). This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options.   This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses. |
| `version` | [Number](/Number "Number")  or   [Text](/Text "Text") | The version of the CreativeWork embodied by a specified resource. |

| Properties from [Thing](/Thing "Thing") | | |
| `additionalType` | [Text](/Text "Text")  or   [URL](/URL "URL") | An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org [style guide](https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html). |
| `alternateName` | [Text](/Text "Text") | An alias for the item. |
| `description` | [Text](/Text "Text")  or   [TextObject](/TextObject "TextObject") | A description of the item. |
| `disambiguatingDescription` | [Text](/Text "Text") | A sub property of description. A short description of the item used to disambiguate from other, similar items. Information from other properties (in particular, name) may be necessary for the description to be useful for disambiguation. |
