# [Alfred-like Shortcuts in Spotlight](https://ma.tt/2025/06/macos-26-spotlight/)

[June 18, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/06/macos-26-spotlight/ "Permalink to Alfred-like Shortcuts in Spotlight")[Apple](https://ma.tt/category/apple/), [WordPress](https://ma.tt/category/wordpress/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

I‚Äôve been testing the developer previews of all the new Apple 26 operating systems, which I don‚Äôt recommend this early in the cycle, but I like to live dangerously. I‚Äôve quickly become accustomed to Liquid Glass. The iPad windowing enhancements do make it feel more like a real computer, but I usually run things in full-screen mode. My favorite thing to play with so far has been the new Spotlight (what pops up when you press Command + Space) and related shortcuts.

I loved [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), I tried [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), but a general life goal this year is to simplify wherever I can, so I‚Äôve been exploring the enhancements in the new Spotlight.

What I‚Äôve found the most useful in the past is [Alfred‚Äôs Open URL Action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/actions/open-url/), which basically lets you type something like ‚Äúgm united reservation‚Äù and it translates that into opening a Gmail search in your browser, with ‚Äúunited reservation‚Äù put in the URL in the right place to run a search.

The Shortcuts app in MacOS and iOS is amazing, which I‚Äôve always known, but I haven‚Äôt played with it much. This was my chance! After a bit of tinkering, I got it to pop up an input form and then run the search. [I Googled a lot to see if it could take input](https://www.google.com/search?q=macos+26+shortcuts+%22receive+input+from+search%22) from the Spotlight search bar and every place said no, I‚Äôm not sure if this is new in MacOS 26 or not but I found the button that makes it work. It‚Äôs not as smooth as Alfred, but it‚Äôs pretty decent. I‚Äôm going to share a screenshot that shows my Gmail search shortcut that takes input from Spotlight ‚Äî¬†the key breakthrough was clicking the (i) menu on the right and finding the checkbox for ‚ÄúReceive Input from Search.‚Äù

![](https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/06/gmail-shortcut-1024x524.jpeg?resize=604%2C309&quality=89&ssl=1)

I gave it a ‚Äúgm‚Äù hotkey, pressed enter, and you get this in Spotlight.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/06/spotlight-with-shortcut-1024x207.png?resize=604%2C122&quality=80&ssl=1)

Tada! Not as nice as Alfred but it gets the job done. My other shortcuts that people might find useful are LI for LinkedIn search, PY is Perplexity, YT for searching the history of YouTube videos I‚Äôve watched, and AM for searching my Amazon order history. (Because I‚Äôm usually trying to find a link for something I‚Äôm recommending, or re-order an item.) Here are the search URLs for everything I‚Äôve mentioned:

* [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/3/#search/) (If you have multiple Google accounts, change the number in the URL to go to the one you want, and then login in that same order every time.)
* <https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/index/?keywords=>
* <https://www.perplexity.ai/search/>
* <https://www.youtube.com/feed/history?query=>
* <https://www.amazon.com/your-orders/search/?search=>

If you dug this, did you know WordPress also has a cool popup shortcut feature? [In 2023, we introduced the Command Palette in the Gutenberg block editor and site editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-command-palette/). To access it on Mac, you press Command + k. I‚Äôd like to bring it to every admin page so it can function more like Spotlight or Raycast for WordPress.

# [Play With Clay](https://ma.tt/2025/06/clay/)

[June 12, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/06/clay/ "Permalink to Play With Clay")[Automattic](https://ma.tt/category/automattic/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

Happy to announce that the amazing [Clay.earth](https://clay.earth/) product and team is joining [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). If you haven‚Äôt tried the app out yet, here‚Äôs a quick video to give you a taste.

[TechCrunch has covered the broader strategy pretty well](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/automattic-acquires-relationship-manager-clay-to-add-an-identity-layer-to-online-tools/): One of the top requests we‚Äôve heard from [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) beta testers is they want to tie in more context, like a personal CRM, and some even requested Clay by name. We‚Äôll keep the apps separate, as Clay also has some interesting team uses, but they will complement and integrate with each other as part of our all-in-one messaging strategy.

We share a vision to integrate Clay‚Äôs technology, which manages over 140 million relationships, as a layer across many of our products and experiences at Automattic. I‚Äôm excited to work with the founders, Matt and Zach, to bring this vision to life. I‚Äôve always felt the missing primitive in WordPress‚Äô content management data architecture was a scalable concept of a Person and Relationships outside of our user table.

[Here‚Äôs the beautiful announcement on the Clay site](https://clay.earth/next) and [on Automattic‚Äôs](https://automattic.com/2025/06/12/automattic-welcomes-clay/).

# [The Five Layers of Sharing Thoughts and Ideas](https://ma.tt/2025/05/sharing-levels/)

[May 27, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/05/sharing-levels/ "Permalink to The Five Layers of Sharing Thoughts and Ideas")[WordPress](https://ma.tt/category/wordpress/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about mimetic formation, how a thought becomes an idea, and how that idea gestates and evolves as it‚Äôs progressively shared in wider and wider circles.

![](https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/05/five-layers-1024x335.png?resize=604%2C198&quality=80&ssl=1)

During a recent product review of [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/), I was struck by how central the app is to my perspective on humans, relationships, and what we share. There are several layers to it, ranging from your innermost thoughts to what you share with the world. Each layer has its own context, challenges, and possibilities, and Automattic offers technology and products tailored to each.

1. Layer one is your internal thoughts. Your consciousness, what exists only in your mind, or what I like to call meatspace. This space is yours and yours alone. This generative space is at the core of human creativity and existence.

2. Layer two is triggered as soon as you put something into a medium, like writing it down. It‚Äôs everything that leaves your head, but is just reserved for you. In the past, we only had physical journals. Today, we have [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) as our strongest product in this space, but many people also have a private WordPress installation just for themselves. There are so many tools out there that help you create! Colors, brushes, canvases. Harper,¬†for example, helps you write better ‚Äî think of it as an open-source [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/), right now just in a few limited contexts, but in the future everywhere you write.

3. Layer three is you and someone else. This is everything you share with one other person, which is an incredibly sacred act. [Shared journals](https://dayoneapp.com/shared-journals/) on Day One, messaging on [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/), DMs, private blogs with your best friend. A shared Google doc. This is its own special space. It has an intimacy and privacy that is core to the human experience. This is also phase 3 of Gutenberg, which is all about real-time co-editing and collaboration. This layer is the one I‚Äôm most excited about expanding in 2025 and 2026.

4. Layer four is sharing within a finite group. N+1. It‚Äôs a space of collaboration and brainstorming with families, tribes, and teams. [P2](https://wordpress.com/p2/), Linear, Github, group chats, and cozy communities. You lose some of the intimacy of layer three but gain more group intelligence.

5. Finally, we have the fifth layer. This is the public layer, where I have spent a lot of my time at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/). It is an extremely competitive space of social media and blogs: [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com), and [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com/). Once you publish publicly, you open yourself up to the beauty and chaos of the wider world. The best reason to blog is comments, the people who find you and add to your thoughts, who you never would have imagined. This is a crucible, but makes your own writing and thinking so much better, it‚Äôs worth the mishegoss. üôÇ

This has been kicking around in my head and at layer four for a while. Thanks to [Kelly Hoffman](https://kelly.blog/) for helping me get this to layer five.

P.S. Happy 22nd birthday to WordPress! [Very excited about the new AI team on .org](https://wordpress.org/news/2025/05/announcing-the-formation-of-the-wordpress-ai-team/).

# [Code Matters](https://ma.tt/2025/05/code-matters/)

It looks like the code that the newly announced Figma Sites is producing isn‚Äôt the best.

There are some cool Figma-to-WordPress workflows; I hope Sites gets more people exploring those options.

# [Remember Gravatar?](https://ma.tt/2025/05/remember-gravatar/)

[May 6, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/05/remember-gravatar/ "Permalink to Remember Gravatar?")[Automattic](https://ma.tt/category/automattic/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

Gravatar has always been about giving people control over their identity online. One avatar, one profile, synced across the web, verified connections, with a fully open API.

Gravatar is a true open identity layer for the internet, [and now for AI](https://blog.gravatar.com/2025/05/06/build-your-ai-identity-with-gravatars-new-tool/).

For [developers](https://docs.gravatar.com/), we‚Äôve rolled out mobile SDKs and a revamped REST API that lets you fetch avatars and profile data with just an email hash. Whether you‚Äôre building a blog, a community, or an AI agent that needs to understand who it‚Äôs talking to, Gravatar provides the infrastructure to make identity seamless and user-centric.

It‚Äôs free, open, and built with developers in mind. We believe identity should belong to the individual, not be locked behind proprietary platforms. Gravatar is our contribution to that vision.‚Äã

If you haven‚Äôt checked it out lately, now‚Äôs a great time to explore what [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com) can do for your app or your online presence. And think about how your apps can drive more Gravatar signups.

# [Berkshire Hathaway Meeting](https://ma.tt/2025/05/berkshire/)

[May 2, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/05/berkshire/ "Permalink to Berkshire Hathaway Meeting")[Automattic](https://ma.tt/category/automattic/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

I‚Äôve checked off a bucket list item: I‚Äôm attending a [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) shareholder meeting. It‚Äôs really an event! Thousands flock to Omaha, Nebraska, for the legendary Q&A sessions with Warren Buffett and shareholder deals. They‚Äôve made it quite the circus, with every Berkshire Hathaway company having a booth of some sort, and typically selling their goods at a discount or with exclusive items you can only buy there, like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Squishmallows (which of course I got, to complement my [bronze busts](https://www.berkshirenerds.store/)).

It‚Äôs strange to have a Dairy Queen booth selling $1 ice cream (cash only!) next to NetJets, but those juxtapositions are part of the Berkshire vibe‚Äîit‚Äôs very high/low, like Costco (a big Berkshire holding). There‚Äôs also an element of WordCamps or a Salesforce Trailblazer event in that you can tell there‚Äôs a ‚Äútype‚Äù of person that‚Äôs easy to spot who‚Äôs a Berkshire enthusiast. A lot of Berkshire brands are also WordPress users: Duracell, GEICO, Acme Brick, Berxi, MiTek. I think there is a lot of mimetic overlap between the values of open source and the values of building a Berkshire company.

As with any big gathering, the side events are also great, and I was honored to have a fireside chat with a friend and Buffett prot√©g√©, [Tracy Britt Cool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Britt_Cool). To an audience of about 60+ CEOs in the [Kanbrick](https://kanbrick.com/) community, we talked about Automattic‚Äôs history and some of the latest happenings in tech; AI was definitely on people‚Äôs minds in the Q&A. They had questions for me, but I also feel like I have a ton to learn from this group that has built founder or family-owned businesses with an average of 80-100M of revenue, the kind of thing that is the engine of the American economy.

It makes me pine for the day when we can have more shareholders in Automattic; I think it would be an amazing cohort of folks that believe in open source and the open web, invested together and learning from each other, and I could imagine an event very much like these shareholder meetings. It‚Äôs so much more powerful when you build a business where your customers are also a community.

**Update:** I knew this would be a special one because it was Warren‚Äôs 60th, but he really went above and beyond by announcing his intention for Greg Abel to take over as CEO at the end of the year. The standing ovation was a special moment, 60 years of 19.9% compounding returns! I think the future of Berkshire is very bright because he‚Äôs shared so much of his worldview that there are others that have made it their own.

# [Reflecting](https://ma.tt/2025/04/reflecting/)

[April 23, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/04/reflecting/ "Permalink to Reflecting")[Personal](https://ma.tt/category/personal/), [WordPress](https://ma.tt/category/wordpress/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

I know there‚Äôs been a lot of frustration directed at me specifically. Some of it, I believe, is misplaced‚Äîbut I also understand where it‚Äôs coming from.

The passing of Pope Francis has deeply impacted me. While I still disagree with the Church on many issues, he was the Pope who broke the mold in so many ways, inspiring me and drawing me back to the Catholic faith I grew up with, with an emphasis on service, compassion, and humility. His passing on Easter Monday, a holiday about rebirth, feels historic. Moments like that invite reflection‚Äînot just on personal choices, but on the broader systems we‚Äôre a part of.

My life, which was primarily about generative creative work that was free for everyone to use, has been subsumed by legal battles. From the start, I‚Äôve said this: after many rounds of negotiation that I approached in good faith, WPE chose to sue. In hindsight, those conversations weren‚Äôt held in the same spirit, and that‚Äôs unfortunate.

But we can‚Äôt rewrite the past. What we can do is decide how we move forward.

The maker-taker problem, at the heart of what we‚Äôve been wrestling with, doesn‚Äôt disappear by avoiding it. If we‚Äôre serious about contributing to the future of open source, and about preserving the legacy of what we‚Äôve built together, we need space to reset. That can‚Äôt happen under the weight of ongoing litigation. The cards are in WPE hands, a fight they‚Äôve started and refuse to end.

So I‚Äôm asking for a moment of reflection for us all as stewards of a shared ecosystem. Let‚Äôs not lose sight of that.

# [Greatest Hits](https://ma.tt/2025/04/greatest-hits/)

I‚Äôve been blogging now for approximately 8,465 days since my first post on Movable Type. My colleague [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/) helped me compile some of the ‚Äúgreatest hits‚Äù from the archives of ma.tt, perhaps some posts will stir some memories for you as well:

# [6.8](https://ma.tt/2025/04/cecil/)

[April 17, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/04/cecil/ "Permalink to 6.8")[WordPress](https://ma.tt/category/wordpress/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

[WordPress 6.8 Cecil is out](https://wordpress.org/news/2025/04/cecil/), and it‚Äôs a great release. It‚Äôs unbelievable that it‚Äôs already [been downloaded over 6 million times as I write this](https://wordpress.org/download/counter/). That feeling never gets old.

It‚Äôs a funny time in WordPress because there are a lot of really interesting open questions:

* Can we iterate faster with canonical plugins?
* What‚Äôs the fun thing we can put in to celebrate 7.0, and when will that be? (I was rooting for real-time co-editing like Notion/Canva/Google Docs.)
* How can we use AI to automate our manual work around WordPress.org?
* Can AI help us make 60k+ open source plugins and themes in the directory more secure? (I think so.)
* What should we do with our 13k issue backlog? (That‚Äôs a lot of bug gardening.)
* How will AI change how people build and update sites?
* Just like RSS and web standards supercharged WordPress for the podcasting and search revolutions, what standards or APIs can we ship to help 40%+ of the web work with AI agents? (Plus an entire rabbit hole of all the new sloppy crawlers using so many resources.)

Some of these broad changes are mixed. At one point, I used Google to search for things and would visit their top result, which is great for website owners. Nowadays, Google pulls almost everything I need into the results page, so I don‚Äôt see as many random sites. But on [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), sometimes I‚Äôll read the answer and then visit 4-5 of the sources it cites to learn more, so I‚Äôm visiting 4-5x more random websites, usually powered by WordPress, than I would have even in the early days of Google. We don‚Äôt know how this all plays out yet.

These questions are also against the backdrop of some of the brightest minds in WordPress spending more time with legal code than computer code, which could last until 2027 or longer with appeals.

Speaking for myself, I was in my first deposition today. I really appreciated the due process and decorum of the rule of law, and just like code, law has a million little quirks, global variables, loaded libraries, and esoteric terminology. But wow, after a full day of that, I‚Äôm mentally exhausted. Hence, I‚Äôm posting about 6.8 after it‚Äôs had 6 million downloads. I‚Äôm more impressed than ever by what smart lawyers do, and the entire thing, though sometimes imperfect and frustrating, is a blessing to our democracy. However, I can‚Äôt wait to return to spending the plurality of my days with engineers and designers again. I‚Äôm sure many other folks in the WordPress community would agree.

The long-anticipated [‚ÄúBig Sky‚Äù AI site builder on WordPress.com went live today](https://wordpress.com/ai-website-builder/?ref=blog).

# [Automattic Operating System](https://ma.tt/2025/03/aos/)

[March 21, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/03/aos/ "Permalink to Automattic Operating System")[Automattic](https://ma.tt/category/automattic/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

*I was interviewed by Inc magazine for almost two hours where we covered a lot of great topics for entrepreneurs but almost none of it made it into the [weird hit piece they published](https://ma.tt/2024/12/inc-hit-piece/), however since both the journalist and I had recording of the interview I‚Äôve decided to adapt some parts of it into a series of blog posts, think of it as the Inc Article That Could Have Been. This bit talks about some of the meta-work that myself and the Bridge team at Automattic do.*  
  
At Automattic, the most important product I work on is the company itself. I‚Äôve started referring to it as the ‚ÄúAutomattic Operating System.‚Äù Not in the technical sense like Linux, but the meta layer the company runs on. The company isn‚Äôt WordPress.com or Beeper or Pocket Casts or any one thing. I‚Äôm responsible for the culture of the people who build those things, building the things that build those things. It‚Äôs our hiring, our HR processes, our expenses, the onboarding docs; it‚Äôs all of the details that make up the employee experience ‚Äî all the stuff that shapes every employee‚Äôs day-to-day experience.

Take expense reports. If you‚Äôve got to spend two hours taking pictures of receipts and something like that, that‚Äôs a waste of time. You‚Äôre not helping a customer there. We switched to a system where everyone just gets a credit card. It does all the reporting and accounting stuff automatically. You just swipe the card and it just automatically files an expense report. Sometimes there‚Äôs an exception and you have to work with the accounting rules, but it just works and automates the whole process most of the time.

Another commonly overlooked detail is the offer letter. We think so much about the design of our websites and our products. We have designers work on that and we put a lot of care and thought into it. But I realized we didn‚Äôt have the same attention to detail on our offer letter. When you think about it, getting an offer letter from a company and deciding to take it is a major life decision, something you only do a handful of times in your life.¬† This is one of the things that determines your life path. Our offer letter was just made by attorneys and HR. No designer had looked at it right. We hadn‚Äôt really thought about it from a product experience point of view. And so it was just this, generic document with bad typography and not great design. But it‚Äôs important, so one of the things we did was redesign it. Now it has a nice letterhead, great typography, and it‚Äôs designed for the end user.  
  
I realized that the salary and stuff was buried in paragraph two. It was just a small thing in the document! Well, what‚Äôs key when you‚Äôre deciding whether to take a job? Start date, salary, you know, that sort of thing, so we put the important parts at the very top.

And then there‚Äôs the legal language. All the legal stuff, which is different in every country. We have people in 90 countries, so there‚Äôs all the legal stuff that goes in there. And then it has this nudge inspired by the behavioral economics book, Predictably Irrational.  
  
There‚Äôs the story about how, if you have an ethics statement above where you sign the test or something, people cheat less. So I thought, well, what‚Äôs our equivalent of that? [We have the Automattic Creed](https://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/). It‚Äôs an important part of our culture. So we put the creed in, it says

> I will never stop learning. I won‚Äôt just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there‚Äôs no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I‚Äôll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it‚Äôs the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that‚Äôs insurmountable.

It‚Äôs not legally binding, but it‚Äôs written in the first person, you read it and you kind of identify with it and then you sign below that. We want people who work at the company who identify with our core values and our core values really are in the creed.

These sorts of things are key to our culture. And they‚Äôre universal. Again, we have people from over 90 countries. These are very different cultures, yes, and very different historical backgrounds and cultural makeups. But what‚Äôs universal? We have our philosophies that we apply every day regardless of where you were born or where you work.

It‚Äôs so funny that my random re-engagement with Radiohead re-emergence coincides with them [doing a new entity that might mean something](https://pitchfork.com/news/radiohead-members-form-new-llp-historically-a-telltale-sign-of-new-activity/). I did a [poll on Twitter and people preferred](https://x.com/photomatt/status/1901705209040011357) OK Computer to Kid A 78%!

Grok told me: ‚ÄúThe band has recently registered a new limited liability partnership (LLP) named RHEUK25, which includes all five members‚ÄîThom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Colin Greenwood, Ed O‚ÄôBrien, and Philip Selway. This move is notable because Radiohead has historically created similar business entities before announcing new albums, tours, or reissues.‚Äù

With the world changing so quickly, it‚Äôs hard to find alpha, but the best way is by following the brightest thinkers. [This CNBC interview with Ray Dalio and Marc Benioff is good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5pF60yUfw0), but it‚Äôs way better if you [go to the livestream about 25 minutes in and see the full discussion without the editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4XTvLZJFcA). You hear what these great thinkers actually think, rather than what an editor thought you‚Äôd enjoy. A little bit of friction gets you a lot more information.

# [Real WordPress Security](https://ma.tt/2025/03/real-wordpress-security/)

[March 8, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/03/real-wordpress-security/ "Permalink to Real WordPress Security")[WordPress](https://ma.tt/category/wordpress/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

One thing you‚Äôll see on every host that offers WordPress is claims about how secure they are, however they don‚Äôt put their money where their mouth is. When you dig deeper, if your site actually gets hacked they‚Äôll hit you with remediation fees that can go from hundreds to thousands of dollars.

They may try to sell you a security plan that [for example at Godaddy goes from $300 to $700 a year on top of your hosting](https://www.godaddy.com/web-security/website-security). (Don‚Äôt be fooled by the low entry price, look at renewal.) It‚Äôs [heartbreaking to hear stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/webhosting/comments/16yqtsj/my_websites_has_been_hacked_malwares_has_been/) of non-technical people forced into these high fees to fix something their host should have prevented in the first place.

When a host is powered by [WP.cloud](https://wp.cloud/), it doesn‚Äôt need to do this because hacks are so incredibly rare. (That‚Äôs why it may appear more expensive, but the total cost of ownership or being a WP.cloud-powered host is much lower when you factor in human time.)

One problem we‚Äôve had on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) is we do all these amazing things and don‚Äôt tell anyone about it, something we‚Äôre trying to change with our focus this year on developers and developer tooling. One great example is **we‚Äôre so confident about our security, if your site gets hacked we‚Äôll fix it for free!** We‚Äôve actually been doing this for the better part of a decade, just never mentioned it anywhere.

[Pressable](https://pressable.com/) (which is WP.cloud-powered) does a better job talking about these things and [has a nice landing page on malware cleaning and hack recovery](https://pressable.com/features/manage/wordpress-hack-recovery-assistance/) that says essentially the same thing.

WordPress has done a ton over the years to move the hosting industry around upgrading PHP and MySQL, PHP extensions, free SSL, and in general using our clout to advocate for user rights and freedoms from even the largest hosting companies, and I‚Äôm proud to say there are a good number, for example the ones you see at WordCamps, that have not just embraced these values but actually been more commercially successful as they‚Äôve done so. I hope security and auto-upgrades not just for core but for plugins and themes becomes the next standard. ([Jetpack does this](https://jetpack.com/features/security/automatic-plugin-updates/) for free, [some hosts charge $100/yr per site](https://cloudup.com/cdrjMTE6nfa).)

# [On Lenny‚Äôs Podcast](https://ma.tt/2025/03/lennys-podcast/)

[March 4, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/03/lennys-podcast/ "Permalink to On Lenny‚Äôs Podcast")[Press](https://ma.tt/category/press/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

One of my must-read newsletters for the past several years has been [Lenny‚Äôs Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/), probably best known for its writing on growth and product management, which really means it covered everything you need to create a great company.

It expanded into a really well-done podcast; Lenny has always had a knack for finding the best guests and asking the best questions, so when he invited me on I was very excited.

He really wanted to address some of the things that people said I wasn‚Äôt being asked, so we do touch on the WP Engine / Silver Lake attacks, but we also covered a lot of my philosophy of why open source is important, philanthropy, and why you should build a movement, not just a product.

You can [watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fves5chVZRA), or [listen to it on your favorite podcast app like Pocket Casts](https://pca.st/episode/ebb90f87-32fb-4a11-9f6e-30e51296d3fb).

Some others he has done that I really enjoyed are [Nan Yu from Linear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTr21kgCFF4), [Marc Benioff from Salesforce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOGK1nlHdFo), [Katie Dill from Stripe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfEEcssu304), [Mihika Kapoor from Figma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDq6_CPaRjM), [Drew Houston from Dropbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egdYKLBswgk), and of course the famous [Founder Mode one with Brian Chesky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ef0juAMqoE).

# [WordCamp Asia and Maha Kumbh Mela](https://ma.tt/2025/02/wcasia-kumbh/)

[February 21, 2025](https://ma.tt/2025/02/wcasia-kumbh/ "Permalink to WordCamp Asia and Maha Kumbh Mela")[Asides](https://ma.tt/category/asides/)[Matt](https://ma.tt/author/saxmatt/ "View all posts by Matt")

It‚Äôs been fantastic being in the Philippines for [this year‚Äôs WordCamp Asia](https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/). We have attendees from 71 countries, over 1,800 tickets sold, and contributor day had over 700 people! It‚Äôs an interesting contrast to US and EU WordCamps as well in that the audience is definitely a lot younger, and there‚Äôs very little interest in ‚Äúwpdrama‚Äù du jour, in fact I‚Äôve had tons of amazing conversations of support and talking about the strength and growth of the community.

Some of the earliest international WordCamps I went to were in Manila and Davao, back in 2008. (I‚Äôm going to share some pictures at the start of my talk.) Between that and spending lots of time in Daly City when I moved to San Francisco when I was 20 I have developed a fondness for the cuisine, creativity, family orientation, and warmth of the culture here.

After this I‚Äôll be taking a bit of time off for a trip to the big Hindu religious pilgrimage in India, the [Maha Kumbh Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumbh_Mela), which is currently on a 144 cycle. It‚Äôs the largest human gathering in the world, with some days measured with tens of millions of people visiting. I‚Äôll be returning to my Photomatt roots as well and bringing my big camera rig, right now a Nikon Z 7II, and two lenses: 24-70 2.8 and 70-200 2.8.

In high school when 5% of your class doesn‚Äôt like you it‚Äôs like 3-5 people.

Running a company of 1,700+ when 5% doesn‚Äôt like you, that‚Äôs 85 people! That fills a room.

150k followers and 5% don‚Äôt like you now you have a small stadium of 7,500 people.

It‚Äôs still 5%.
