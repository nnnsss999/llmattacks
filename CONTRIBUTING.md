# Contributing Guide

Thank you for helping improve the LLM Attacks Catalog. To keep the repository consistent, please follow these rules:

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch.
2. Add or update Markdown files in `docs/`. Use **kebab-case** filenames.
3. Include YAML front matter at the top with at least:
   ```yaml
   title: "Example Attack"
   category: "Prompt Injection"
   source_url: "https://example.com/paper"
   date_collected: YYYY-MM-DD
   license: "Fair Use"
   ```
4. Submit a pull request referencing any relevant issues.

## Style

- Prefer Markdown over HTML; run content through a converter if needed.
- Cite sources inline with standard Markdown links.
- Keep excerpts from third-party sources under 75 words and note the license in the front matter.
