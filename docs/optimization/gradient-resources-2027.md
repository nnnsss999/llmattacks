The following papers and reports extend the catalog with gradient-based jailbreak attacks and defenses published after 2026.

- [Exponentiated Gradient Jailbreak](https://www.promptfoo.dev/lm-security-db/vuln/exponentiated-gradient-jailbreak-c4fb2fa8) – vulnerability note describing exponentiated gradient descent to craft adversarial prompts that bypass safety alignment.
- [PIG: Privacy Jailbreak Attack on LLMs via Gradient-based Iterative In-Context Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09921) – framework using iterative gradient updates to leak personally identifiable information.
- [Gradient-based Jailbreak Images for Multimodal Fusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03489) – introduces tokenizer shortcuts to enable gradient optimization of image inputs for multimodal LLMs.
- [Unraveling the Mystery: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks Via Unearthing Real Intention](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.560) – defense uses gradient-based deletion of irrelevant tokens to reduce attack success rates.
- [LLM Abuse Prevention Tool Using GCG Jailbreak Attack Detection and DistilBERT-Based Ethics Judgment](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/16/3/204) – proposes syntax and gradient analysis to detect greedy coordinate gradient attacks.
- [Automatic Prompt Optimization with "Gradient Descent" and Beam Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03495) – early work that automates prompt improvement by applying gradient-like updates guided by beam search.
