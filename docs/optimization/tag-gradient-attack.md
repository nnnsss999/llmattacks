Originally published at EMNLP 2021, **TAG** proposes a white-box gradient attack that perturbs token embeddings to generate harmful completions. The paper shows that gradient guidance can produce minimally modified prompts that trigger undesirable behaviour in transformer models while preserving grammaticality. This early work laid the groundwork for more recent gradient-based jailbreak techniques.
