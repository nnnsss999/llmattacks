The 2024 paper **Improved Techniques for Optimization-Based Jailbreaking on Large Language Models** refines gradient-driven attacks like GCG.
Key contributions include adaptive learning schedules and momentum terms that accelerate convergence to high-success prompts. The authors demonstrate superior success rates on aligned models compared to earlier methods.
