This update lists additional references covering evolutionary and genetic algorithm approaches for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). These works appear after the 2025 catalog snapshot and highlight ongoing research on automated prompt generation.

- [Geneshift: Impact of Different Scenario Shift on Jailbreaking LLM](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3df013a9b4628e16e54e6da6ce9c33f54cef46a) – explores evolutionary search under varied evaluation settings.
- [Breaking the Ceiling: Exploring the Potential of Jailbreak Attacks through Expanding Strategy Space](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1f2f65d18deabcb35b9814a7b7356338f905d0c) – analyzes optimization strategies including genetic algorithms.
- [xJailbreak: Representation Space Guided Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable LLM Jailbreaking](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f88411c138583c3875009db49291e1daafc825ba) – demonstrates a hybrid of gradient and evolutionary methods.
- [LLaMEA: A Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm for Automatically Generating Metaheuristics](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8f9e7812aad3a1162424d3b094d2b425f9f701b6) – presents an EA framework that can be adapted for jailbreaking tasks.

These resources strengthen the catalog by documenting recent trends in evolutionary approaches to adversarial prompt search.
