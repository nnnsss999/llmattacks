The **Open Sesame** paper introduces a genetic algorithm (GA) approach for generating universal adversarial prompts that jailbreak large language models without access to model internals. The GA iteratively evolves candidate prompts, selecting those that maximize harmful responses while maintaining transferability across models. This optimization uncovers alignment weaknesses even in black-box settings, demonstrating the power of evolutionary search for automated jailbreaks.
