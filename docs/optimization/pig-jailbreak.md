The 2025 paper **PIG** proposes a privacy-oriented jailbreak attack that iteratively tunes in-context examples using gradient signals. By optimizing the prompt to maximize leaked information, PIG extracts sensitive data from models that would otherwise refuse. The attack works even in black-box settings through gradient estimation.
