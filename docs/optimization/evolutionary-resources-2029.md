The following list extends the catalog of genetic and evolutionary algorithm approaches for jailbreaking or otherwise attacking large language models (LLMs).
These newer references highlight multi-objective optimization, practical exploit guides, and public vulnerability databases.

- [BlackDAN: A Black-Box Multi-Objective Approach for Effective and Stealthy LLM Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09804) – uses evolutionary multi-objective search to craft robust jailbreak prompts.
- [Semantic Mirror Jailbreak: Genetic Algorithm Based Jailbreak Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14872) – evolves paraphrased prompts that retain semantics while bypassing safety filters.
- [A Genetic Algorithm Framework for Jailbreaking Large Language Models](https://novaresearch.unl.pt/en/publications/a-genetic-algorithm-framework-for-jailbreaking-large-language-mod) – proposes a full GA framework for prompt optimization.
- [Evolutionary LLM Jailbreak | LLM Security Database](https://www.promptfoo.dev/lm-security-db/vuln/undefined-d8228765) – database entry summarizing evolutionary attacks in real deployments.
- [Multi-Objective LLM Jailbreak | LLM Security Database](https://www.promptfoo.dev/lm-security-db/vuln/undefined-8bd6e153) – documents the BlackDAN approach and mitigation tips.
- [AI Deep Dive: LLM Jailbreaking](https://www.bugcrowd.com/blog/ai-deep-dive-llm-jailbreaking/) – discusses genetic algorithm techniques alongside other jailbreak strategies.

These additions showcase the expanding use of evolutionary algorithms for automated jailbreak generation and analysis.
