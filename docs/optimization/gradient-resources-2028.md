- [Adversarial Attack on Large Language Models using Exponentiated Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09820) – describes an exponentiated gradient descent method to generate high-success adversarial prompts.
- [DualBreach: Efficient Dual-Jailbreaking via Target-Driven Initialization and Multi-Target Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18564) – optimizes approximate gradients against both guardrails and base models to save queries.
- [From Hallucinations to Jailbreaks: Rethinking the Vulnerability of Large Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24232) – proposes a unified gradient-based view of token-level and attention-level vulnerabilities.
- [Model Unlearning via Sparse Autoencoder Subspace Guided Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24428) – leverages gradient-driven unlearning to reduce malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts.
- [Safety Alignment via Constrained Knowledge Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18588) – prunes sensitive neuron gradients to maintain safety while preserving utility.
