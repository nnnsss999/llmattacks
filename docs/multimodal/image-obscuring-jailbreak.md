Adversaries can hide jailbreak prompts within partially blurred or corrupted pictures. By
obscuring text with noise or layered patterns, the image evades simple keyword filters yet
remains readable to OCR-based pipelines in vision-enabled LLMs. Recent studies show that
even low-opacity overlays can bypass safety detectors once the underlying text is recovered
by the model.
