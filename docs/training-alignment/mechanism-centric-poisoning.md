The position paper **"Multi-Faceted Studies on Data Poisoning can Advance LLM Development"** argues that controlled poisoning can reveal how training data shapes model behavior. It outlines a mechanism-centric agenda where poisoning is used to probe memorization and reasoning pathways.

Key scenarios discussed include:

- **Dirty Label Poisoning** – mixing incorrect labels to subvert fine-tuning objectives.
- **Backdoor Attacks for Memorization** – implanting triggers so LLMs respond with attacker-controlled outputs.
- **Flash-Freeze Poisoning** – injecting ephemeral data that influences short-term training phases.

By examining these strategies, the paper suggests that understanding poisoning mechanisms can ultimately lead to more robust and trustworthy LLMs.
