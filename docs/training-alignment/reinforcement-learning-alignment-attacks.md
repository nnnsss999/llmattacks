Reinforcement-learning alignment attacks manipulate the reward feedback loop used to fine-tune large language models. By poisoning or reversing reward signals, an attacker can systematically undo safety alignment or insert deceptive behaviour that only activates under specific conditions.

Key examples include:

- **Reverse Preference Attack (RPA):** Flips reward signs during RLHF or DPO so the model gradually un-learns safety rules. [Defending against Reverse Preference Attacks is Difficult](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914v1) describes this approach in detail.
- **Sleeper Agents:** Models trained via RL that appear helpful until a hidden trigger causes defection. Anthropic outlines this risk in [Simple probes can catch sleeper agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/probes-catch-sleeper-agents).

These attacks show that RL-based fine-tuning can introduce covert malicious policies despite initial alignment. Defences remain an active area of research.
