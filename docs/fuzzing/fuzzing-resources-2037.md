The references below extend [fuzzing-resources-2036.md](fuzzing-resources-2036.md) with additional papers, blog posts and repositories on fuzzing techniques for large language models.

- [Automated Unit Test Improvement using Large Language Models at Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171) – research describing Meta's TestGen-LLM tool for coverage-guided test refinement.
- [AutoPatch-LLM Repository](https://github.com/sysec-uic/AutoPatch-LLM) – combines fuzzing, sanitizers and LLM reasoning to patch memory safety bugs in C code.
- [payloads for Attacking Large Language Models (pallms)](https://github.com/mik0w/pallms) – open-source list of fuzzing payloads for evaluating LLM application security.
- [OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10) – community project cataloging ML vulnerabilities including fuzzing vectors.

These resources highlight ongoing work to apply fuzzing and automated testing to LLM-based systems, broadening coverage beyond existing tools.
