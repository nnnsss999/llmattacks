Researchers from Carnegie Mellon show that coordinated LLM agents can autonomously exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities. Their **HPTSA** framework launches specialized subagents to explore targets and combine partial exploits. In tests on 14 real-world flaws, teams of agents succeeded up to 4.3Ã— more often than prior approaches.
