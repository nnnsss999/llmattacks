This newsletter article discusses how zero-day threats evolve when applied to machine learning. It argues that AI zero-days stem from data-driven behaviour rather than simple code bugs, citing attacks like adversarial examples and data poisoning. Links to further reading include a paper on zero-day attacks against ML algorithms.
