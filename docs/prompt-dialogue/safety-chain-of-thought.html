###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) are vital for a wide range of applications yet remain susceptible to jailbreak threats, which could lead to the generation of inappropriate responses. Conventional defenses, such as refusal and adversarial training, often fail to cover corner cases or rare domains, leaving LLMs still vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks. We propose a novel defense strategy, Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which harnesses the enhanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs for proactive assessment of harmful inputs, rather than simply blocking them. SCoT augments any refusal training datasets to critically analyze the intent behind each request before generating answers. By employing proactive reasoning, SCoT enhances the generalization of LLMs across varied harmful queries and scenarios not covered in the safety alignment corpus. Additionally, it generates detailed refusals specifying the rules violated. Comparative evaluations show that SCoT significantly surpasses existing defenses, reducing vulnerability to out-of-distribution issues and adversarial manipulations while maintaining strong general capabilities.

1 Introduction
--------------

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities, enabling their wide applications in fields such as education(zhang2024simulating), programming(perez2020copilot), and everyday tasks. However, their powerful nature also introduces risks, as they can inadvertently generate harmful instructions or inappropriate content, leading to unsafe or illegal outcomes. For instance, prior research has shown that malicious users can compromise LLMs through adversarial techniques such as jailbreaks(zou2023universal; liu2024autodan), which bypass safety restrictions and prompt models to generate harmful outputs. These outputs may include instructions for breaching computer systems(zou2023universal) or facilitating unauthorized access to copyrighted materials(mazeika2024harmbenchstandardizedevaluationframework). Such misuse not only violates ethical standards in AI deployment but also leads to severe consequences, including financial losses, reputational harm, and legal liabilities. Given these concerns, ensuring the safety and ethical deployment of LLMs is paramount. Addressing safety challenges is not only critical to preventing potential harm but also essential to fostering trust and acceptance of these technologies in society.

Figure 1:  An example of a comparison between our Safety Chain of Thought (SCoT) defense and conventional safety-aligned defenses against the suppress refusal attack. The conventional safety-aligned model adheres to the instruction to avoid outputting refusal words, thus it is jail-broken. In contrast, our tool proactively assesses the harmful intent of the request and successfully defends against the attack. 

A common way to achieve safety defense is safety alignment or refusal training(bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant), where LLMs are trained to reject harmful instructions. However, these strategies fail to defend against increasingly sophisticated attacks as their design and training recipes are still vulnerable to these emerging threats. These attacks often take advantage of two main weaknesses of the refusal training: (1) out-of-distribution scenarios, where the harmful input is not covered by safety training datasets but is in the pretraining stage, and (2) competing objectives, where attackers could add harmful suffixes or introduce distracting role-play content to harmful questions to manipulate the model into starting its response positively (wei2024jailbroken). These methods exploit the way LLMs are trained and predict text, leading to inappropriate outputs. Even advanced models like GPT-4(openai2024gpt4technicalreport) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet(Anthropic2024) remain vulnerable to these sophisticated methods, underscoring the urgent need for more adaptive and robust defense mechanisms.

We envision that human‚Äôs thinking process of responding to a given harmful query is to access whether it is appropriate to give the answer in mind and then provide the response to the answer or refusal. Motivated by this cognitive process humans approach complex decisions and the recent advancements in the reasoning abilities of LLMs, we propose a novel defense strategy that fundamentally diverges from traditional approaches. This method, which we name SCoT: S afety C hain-o f-T hought, instructs the model to first analyze the potential harmfulness of the request before giving the corresponding response. As depicted in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‚Ä£ 1 Introduction ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought"), this reasoning-based approach allows the model to engage in a ‚Äúthinking process‚Äù to categorize the request into predefined violations, enabling it to generalize effectively to different variants of harmful questions and out-of-distribution scenarios that are not explicitly covered in the safety training corpus. Moreover, this proactive reflective mechanism naturally defends against attacks designed to elicit affirmative outputs. By requiring the model to evaluate the request‚Äôs intent before responding, our SCoT mitigates the risk of manipulation, ensuring a higher degree of robustness and adaptability compared to traditional defenses.

We rigorously evaluate SCoT across a comprehensive range of attack scenarios, encompassing 10 distinct black-box and white-box attack types. SCoT is benchmarked against safety-aligned models and some of the most advanced state-of-the-art defense strategies as outlined in recent studies(zou2024circuitbreaker; mazeika2024harmbenchstandardizedevaluationframework). Comparative evaluations demonstrate that SCoT significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of resilience and response accuracy. Specifically, the results reveal that SCoT achieves a near-zero attack success rate, effectively generalizing to unseen attacks such as those attempting to suppress refusals(wei2024jailbroken). Moreover, it maintains robust general capabilities across standard operational scenarios, underscoring its superior adaptation to evolving security challenges and highlighting its sustained effectiveness.

To summarize, our contributions are three-fold:

*   ‚Ä¢A novel defense methodology. We propose a new defense approach, SCoT which leverages reasoning-based analysis to defend against the most sophisticated and powerful attacks against LLMs, fundamentally diverging from traditional defenses. 
*   ‚Ä¢Strong defense performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that SCoT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense strategies, offering superior robustness against out-of-distribution and adversarial attacks. 
*   ‚Ä¢Model and resources release. We open-source our trained model and accompanying resources to facilitate further research and encourage collaboration within the AI safety community. 

2 Background and Preliminary
----------------------------

### 2.1 Large Language Models

A large language model ‚Ñ≥ ‚Ñ≥\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M generates human-like text by predicting words iteratively: x i^=‚Ñ≥‚Å¢(x i‚à£x 1,‚Ä¶,x i‚àí1)^subscript ùë• ùëñ ‚Ñ≥ conditional subscript ùë• ùëñ subscript ùë• 1‚Ä¶subscript ùë• ùëñ 1\hat{x_{i}}=\mathcal{M}(x_{i}\mid x_{1},\dots,x_{i-1})over^ start_ARG italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG = caligraphic_M ( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚à£ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) given the preceding sequence (x 1,‚Ä¶,x i‚àí1)subscript ùë• 1‚Ä¶subscript ùë• ùëñ 1(x_{1},\dots,x_{i-1})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i - 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ). State-of-the-art LLMs leverage transformer architectures(vaswani2017attention) and are trained on large-scale corpora(openai2024gpt4technicalreport). Despite their capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. This work focuses on strengthening LLMs‚Äô resilience against such attacks. Specifically, let ‚Ñ≥‚Å¢(q)‚Ñ≥ ùëû\mathcal{M}(q)caligraphic_M ( italic_q ) denote the model‚Äôs response to a harmful query q ùëû q italic_q. Effective safety mechanisms should ensure that the model consistently produces a refusal or a non-harmful response.

### 2.2 Jailbreak Attacks

In jailbreak attacks, the adversary aims to craft harmful questions, which could bypass the safety filtering of LLMs, making them produce unsafe responses. Let q ùëû q italic_q be a harmful question, which will be rejected by the LLM. The objective of the attacker is to construct a jailbreak question q‚Ä≤superscript ùëû‚Ä≤q^{\prime}italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, which preserves the same semantic meaning as q ùëû q italic_q, but could mislead the LLM to produce a harmful response. Existing attack methods fall into three categories: linguistic manipulation, contextual manipulation, and adaptive attacks.

Linguistic Manipulation. The key idea of this strategy is to alter the linguistic tone of the harmful question q ùëû q italic_q to evade LLM‚Äôs safety checking. Examples of linguistic manipulation include translating text into low-resource languages(deng2024multilingualjailbreakchallengeslarge), employing slang(xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge), performing ASCII transformations, using Base64 encoding(wei2024jailbroken), and introducing intentional misspellings. These techniques can effectively bypass safety mechanisms by transforming input tokens into scenarios that appear out-of-distribution.

Contextual Manipulation. This strategy alters q ùëû q italic_q to q‚Ä≤superscript ùëû‚Ä≤q^{\prime}italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT by incorporating specific contextual elements like background information or persuasive language. Examples of contextual manipulation include adding role-play scenarios, evidence-based persuasion, or logical appeal that are designed to manipulate model behavior(xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge; wei2024jailbroken). Such attacks typically involve meticulously crafted, human-written prompts that strategically influence the model‚Äôs responses. They exploit the model‚Äôs vulnerabilities by either prompting it to have a competing objective to ignore system instructions or by presenting inputs that the model does not recognize as harmful, thereby bypassing the established safety mechanisms(wei2024jailbroken).

Adaptive Attack. An adaptive attack views the challenge as an optimization problem, iteratively modifying q ùëû q italic_q to {q 1,q 2‚Å¢‚Ä¶,q n}subscript ùëû 1 subscript ùëû 2‚Ä¶subscript ùëû ùëõ\{q_{1},q_{2}\dots,q_{n}\}{ italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚Ä¶ , italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } via optimizing a fitness function that indicates the likelihood of an affirmative answer. GCG(zou2023universal) defines the fitness function as the loss of affirmative responses with respect to the input, utilizing fuzzing techniques to refine q i subscript ùëû ùëñ q_{i}italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT until a successful output is achieved or the query budget is exhausted. AutoDAN(liu2024autodan) uses evolutionary algorithms to generate mutations for input modification. PAIR(chao2024jailbreakingblackboxlarge) diverges by using an external LLM to propose modifications based on the attack history Q={q 1,q 2,‚Ä¶,q i}ùëÑ subscript ùëû 1 subscript ùëû 2‚Ä¶subscript ùëû ùëñ Q=\{q_{1},q_{2},\dots,q_{i}\}italic_Q = { italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , ‚Ä¶ , italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT }. Those attack take advantage of both the competing objective and out-of-distribution simultaneously.

### 2.3 Defense

Existing defense strategies against jailbreak attacks on LLMs include refusal training, such as Llama3-8b-Instruct(schulman2017proximalpolicyoptimizationalgorithms; bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant), adversarial training (AdvTrain)(mazeika2024harmbenchstandardizedevaluationframework), and Circuitbreaker(zou2024circuitbreaker). Refusal training, particularly when combined with techniques like RLHF and PPO(schulman2017proximalpolicyoptimizationalgorithms), empowers LLMs to reject unsafe prompts by reinforcing ethical decision-making during training. AdvTrain, motivated by adversarial training in computer vision, enhances models by fine-tuning with adversarial examples to help them recognize and resist harmful manipulations. On the other hand, Circuitbreaker aims to prevent the generation of harmful content by actively removing dangerous knowledge from the model during processing.

However, these methods are less effective against sophisticated attacks that use out-of-distribution and competing objectives. Instruction-following models tend to obey user commands. When adversaries craft harmful queries positively, they can easily bypass safety systems. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more effective defense strategies against these tactics.

3 Our Approach
--------------

To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel jailbreak defense method, Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), summarized in Figure[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S2.F2 "Figure 2 ‚Ä£ 2.1 Large Language Models ‚Ä£ 2 Background and Preliminary ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought"). Unlike traditional refusal training techniques that immediately block responses upon detecting harmful content(bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant), SCoT requires the model to proactively analyze the harmful intent behind user requests before generating responses. This approach contains three key stages. First, we ‚ù∂ enhance the complexity and diversity of adversarial scenarios through question evolution (Section [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Question Evolution ‚Ä£ 3 Our Approach ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought")), which expands harmful questions through jailbreak mutations. We then ‚ù∑ establish a structured cognitive process for analyzing requests through malicious intent abstraction and safety regulation assessment for both harmful and benign question dataset (Section [3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 Cognitive Reasoning Construction ‚Ä£ 3 Our Approach ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought")). Finally, we apply ‚ù∏ supervised fine-tuning on the newly developed safety reasoning dataset to enhance model‚Äôs broader reasoning capabilities while reinforcing its ability to resist jailbreak attempts (Section [3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S3.SS3 "3.3 Supervised Fine-Tuning ‚Ä£ 3 Our Approach ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought")).

### 3.1 Question Evolution

As described in Section [2.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S2.SS2 "2.2 Jailbreak Attacks ‚Ä£ 2 Background and Preliminary ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought"), jailbreak attacks typically employ two main strategies: (1) linguistic manipulation, which subtly alters the question‚Äôs phrasing with different tones, and (2) contextual manipulation, which includes distracting content to provoke affirmative or unintended responses. Inspired by the advancements in complex training scenarios demonstrated by WizardLM(xu2024wizardlm; luo2024wizardcoder), we aim to enhance the model‚Äôs reasoning capabilities by introducing more intricate questions. We develop complexity through two specific methods: depth evolution, which focuses on linguistic nuances, and breadth evolution, which incorporates distracting elements. This strategy is designed to counteract the effectiveness of adversarial manipulations by improving the model‚Äôs ability to discern and respond to nuanced intents within adversarial inputs.

Linguistic Manipulation. Linguistic manipulation involves subtly altering the phrasing of questions to bypass model defenses while retaining their original intent. In response, we enrich the question q ùëû q italic_q with diverse linguistic styles, specifically slang and uncommon dialects, to enhance the attack robustness against detection.

We implement this by utilizing In-Context Learning with a contemporary LLM, supported by a carefully curated set of demonstrations. To ensure the generation of diverse stylistic variants, we need to select demonstrations with different styles. We employ SorryBench(xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge), which includes a rich corpus of slang and uncommon dialect texts. We begin by extracting semantic embeddings from the dataset entries using SentenceBERT(reimers2019sentencebertsentenceembeddingsusing). We then apply k-means clustering to these embeddings with k ùëò k italic_k clusters and select the centers of these clusters as our demonstrations. To further enhance the style diversity in the model‚Äôs outputs, we design explicit prompts for the LLM that encourage the generation of responses in varied styles, rather than strictly replicating the demonstrated examples. Details of the full prompt structure and the selected demonstrations are provided in Appendix[A.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#A1.SS2 "A.2 Contextual Evolution Prompts ‚Ä£ Appendix A SCoT Construction ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") and Appendix[A.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#A1.SS3 "A.3 Selected demonstrations ‚Ä£ Appendix A SCoT Construction ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought"). An example of our question evolution with linguistic manipulation is in Figure[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S3.F3 "Figure 3 ‚Ä£ 3.1 Question Evolution ‚Ä£ 3 Our Approach ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought").

Figure 3: An example of evolved questions with slang and uncommon dialect styles.

This strategy not only expands the model‚Äôs adaptability to linguistic variations but also strengthens its defenses against sophisticated manipulative inputs.

Contextual Manipulation. We further expand the harmful question q ùëû q italic_q by incorporating contextual backgrounds to elicit affirmative responses. This is achieved with a variety of sophisticated persuasion techniques, including role-playing, expert endorsements, evidence-based persuasion, and logical appeals, each chosen for its effectiveness in nuanced scenario handling.

We adopt a methodology akin to that for linguistic manipulations, where we carefully select a set of representative and diverse examples from the SorryBench(xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge) subset with different persuasion techniques. These examples serve as demonstrations for In-Context Learning with our LLM, enabling to generate questions that are intricately complex and less predictable. The detailed prompt is in Appendix[A.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#A1.SS2 "A.2 Contextual Evolution Prompts ‚Ä£ Appendix A SCoT Construction ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought"). Due to the page limit, an example of our question evolution for contextual manipulation is in Appendix[A.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#A1.SS4 "A.4 Examples of contextual manipulation evolution. ‚Ä£ Appendix A SCoT Construction ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought").

### 3.2 Cognitive Reasoning Construction

Given a refusal training dataset ùíü={(q,r)}n ùíü superscript ùëû ùëü ùëõ\mathcal{D}=\{(q,r)\}^{n}caligraphic_D = { ( italic_q , italic_r ) } start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT containing n ùëõ n italic_n pairs of questions q ùëû q italic_q and refusal responses r ùëü r italic_r, our goal is to enhance the refusal responses by incorporating safety reasoning in the form of a Chain-of-Thought guided by safety regulations. Leveraging this classification, we craft prompts for leading LLMs, such as GPT4, to generate responses in a structured three-stage format: (1) analyzing the intent of user requests, (2) explaining why the request does or does not align with one or more identified harmful categories, and (3) issuing a refusal response. Details of these prompts are given in Appendix[A.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#A1.SS3 "A.3 Selected demonstrations ‚Ä£ Appendix A SCoT Construction ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought"). The safety CoT is shown as follows:

####Verify Request

I need to verify the dangerousness of the

user‚Äôs request to[summary]with following

categories before generating the response.

*harassment/threatening:[reason]

*hate/threatening:[reason]

*illicit/violent:[reason]

*self-harm/intent/instructions:[reason]

*sexual/minors:[reason]

*violence/graphic:[reason]

*misinformation:[reason]

*privacy/sensitive:[reason]

Therefore,the user‚Äôs request likely

involves a clear reference to[categories],

which could lead to unsafe behavior.

Therefore,I need to reject the request.

####Response

I am sorry,but I cannot help with that.

Here, [summary] summarizes each question, encouraging the LLM to analyze the query intent first, especially when confronted with distracting content. The placeholder [reason] is replaced with ‚ÄúYes‚Äù along with a valid explanation if applicable, or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù otherwise. Finally, [categories] list the relevant categories identified. In the reasoning construction process, we primarily identify eight categories of potentially harmful content, i.e., harassment, hate speech, illicit/violent content, self-harm, sexual content, violence, misinformation, and privacy violations, by following OpenAI‚Äôs safety guidelines and Google‚Äôs regulation framework.

### 3.3 Supervised Fine-Tuning

Our objective is to train the model to proactively assess the harmfulness of each input before generating responses. Training exclusively on refusal reasoning risks conditioning the model to reject all inputs indiscriminately. To counteract this, we implement supervised fine-tuning using our SCoT dataset, complemented by a dataset of benign samples to retain balanced decision-making capabilities.

Retain Dataset Construction. We construct a benign dataset ùíü b={(q)}k subscript ùíü ùëè superscript ùëû ùëò\mathcal{D}_{b}=\{(q)\}^{k}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { ( italic_q ) } start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, containing k ùëò k italic_k benign questions. The augmented answer is divided into two components: the safety reasoning process and the original output generated by our target model ‚Ñ≥ ‚Ñ≥\mathcal{M}caligraphic_M. This reasoning process is illustrated as follows:

####Verify Request

I need to verify the dangerousness of the

user‚Äôs request to[summary]across the

following categories before generating the

response.

*harassment/threatening:No.

*hate/threatening:No.

*illicit/violent:No.

*self-harm/intent/instructions:No.

*sexual/minors:No.

*violence/graphic:No.

*misinformation:No.

*privacy/sensitive:No.

Therefore,the user‚Äôs request is safe,and

I can proceed to generate the response.

####Response

[output]

To implement this, we utilize a prominent LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate summaries for the benign questions. Subsequently, to preserve the model‚Äôs integrity during fine-tuning, we collect responses a=‚Ñ≥‚Å¢(q)ùëé ‚Ñ≥ ùëû a=\mathcal{M}(q)italic_a = caligraphic_M ( italic_q ) from the model. These summaries and responses are then integrated into the format above, which mimics the safety reasoning Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), ensuring that the model applies consistent evaluation criteria to both harmful and benign queries.

SFT. We train the model using two datasets from our SCoT: the refined dataset ùíü r S‚Å¢C‚Å¢o‚Å¢T={(q‚Ä≤,r‚Ä≤)}subscript superscript ùíü ùëÜ ùê∂ ùëú ùëá ùëü superscript ùëû‚Ä≤superscript ùëü‚Ä≤\mathcal{D}^{SCoT}_{r}=\{(q^{\prime},r^{\prime})\}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_S italic_C italic_o italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { ( italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) }, where q‚Ä≤superscript ùëû‚Ä≤q^{\prime}italic_q start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT represents the evolved harmful questions and r‚Ä≤superscript ùëü‚Ä≤r^{\prime}italic_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT denotes refusal answers with an embedded reasoning chain, and the retain dataset ùíü b S‚Å¢C‚Å¢o‚Å¢T={(q,r)}subscript superscript ùíü ùëÜ ùê∂ ùëú ùëá ùëè ùëû ùëü\mathcal{D}^{SCoT}_{b}=\{(q,r)\}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_S italic_C italic_o italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = { ( italic_q , italic_r ) }, where q ùëû q italic_q are benign questions and r ùëü r italic_r are the correspondingly augmented benign answers that also include a reasoning chain. The objective of training is to minimize the following composite loss function:

‚Ñí ‚Ñí\displaystyle\mathcal{L}caligraphic_L=‚Ñí ùíü r S‚Å¢C‚Å¢o‚Å¢T+Œª‚Å¢‚Ñí ùíü b S‚Å¢C‚Å¢o‚Å¢T absent subscript ‚Ñí subscript superscript ùíü ùëÜ ùê∂ ùëú ùëá ùëü ùúÜ subscript ‚Ñí subscript superscript ùíü ùëÜ ùê∂ ùëú ùëá ùëè\displaystyle=\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{D}^{SCoT}_{r}}+\lambda\mathcal{L}_{% \mathcal{D}^{SCoT}_{b}}= caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_S italic_C italic_o italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_Œª caligraphic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT caligraphic_D start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_S italic_C italic_o italic_T end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT(1)

We employ the circuitbreaker dataset introduced by (zou2024circuitbreaker) as our base dataset ùíü r subscript ùíü ùëü\mathcal{D}_{r}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_r end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for further development. This dataset comprises 4,994 short harmful requests across 48 harmful topics. For the retain dataset ùíü b subscript ùíü ùëè\mathcal{D}_{b}caligraphic_D start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_b end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, we utilize dolly-15k(DatabricksBlog2023DollyV2) to preserve the general capabilities of the models. The Dolly-15k dataset is an open-source instruction-following records with diverse categories such as brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA, and summarization.

SCoT Construction. We employ GPT-4o-mini(openai2024gpt4technicalreport) to evolve both the base questions and the answers as detailed in Sections[3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S3.SS2 "3.2 Cognitive Reasoning Construction ‚Ä£ 3 Our Approach ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") and [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S3.SS1 "3.1 Question Evolution ‚Ä£ 3 Our Approach ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") respectively. For adapting the questions, we select demonstrations of different styles from sorrybench(xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge) and conduct few-shot In-Context learning. Detailed construction process are provided in Appendix[A](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#A1 "Appendix A SCoT Construction ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought").

Training Base Models and Hyperparameters. We employ two open-source models specifically tuned for safety, including Llama3-8B-Instrct(llama3modelcard) and Mistral-7B-V0.2(jiang2023mistral7b), without system prompts. Training is conducted using LoRA(hu2021loralowrankadaptationlarge). For the LoRA module, we specify a rank of 64, an Œ± ùõº\alpha italic_Œ± value of 128, a dropout rate of 0.1, and learned LoRA matrices for all attention matrices. In the supervised fine-tuning stage, we set Œª=1 ùúÜ 1\lambda=1 italic_Œª = 1 in Equation[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S3.E1 "Equation 1 ‚Ä£ 3.3 Supervised Fine-Tuning ‚Ä£ 3 Our Approach ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") and the training epoch to 2. The initial learning rate is set to 2‚Å¢e‚àí5 2 ùëí 5 2e-5 2 italic_e - 5 and the batch size to 2. Training is carried out on two Ada 6000 GPUs and takes approximately two hours to complete.

Baselines. We evaluate our SCoT by comparing it with three distinct baselines. The first includes the original Mistral and Llama-3 Instruct models, serving as the simplest comparison point. Next, we assess against the circuitbreaker approach(zou2024circuitbreaker), which mitigates harmful content by projecting harmful representations into a randomized space, effectively creating a protective ‚Äúcircuit‚Äù against harmful requests. Finally, we compare our results to an adversarially trained version of the Mistral model, known as R2D2(mazeika2024harmbenchstandardizedevaluationframework). We obtain the baseline models from the Huggingface repository(wolf2020huggingfacestransformersstateoftheartnatural), as released by the original authors.

Table 1: Evaluation of LLM jailbreak attack success rates (ASR). The term ‚ÄúNone‚Äù denotes verbatim harmful requests. Labels (A) and (J) correspond to the evaluation results from A dvbench and J ailbreakbench, respectively. For GCG attack for baselinses, results are taken from the reported findings in the Circuitbreaker paper(zou2024circuitbreaker) and are indicated with a superscript *.

Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate the output harmfulness, the conventional method is substring matching using predefined refusal prefixes. However, the circuitbreaker approach ceases output upon detecting harmful content instead of issuing refusal answers. Consequently, we employ the Llama3Guard classifier(dubey2024llama3herdmodels) to assess the Attack Success Rate (ASR), determining whether generated outputs contain harmful content. As for evaluating general capabilities, we use accuracy as the metric.

### 4.2 Jailbreak Evaluation

Setup. We summarize the jailbreak attacks used for our evaluations, organized by the strategy and datasets employed:

*   ‚Ä¢No attack: As a control, we use a non-jailbreaking approach that echoes each prompt verbatim, facilitating baseline comparisons. Evaluations are performed using JailbreakBench(chao2024jailbreakbenchopenrobustnessbenchmark) with 100 harmful questions and AdvBench(zou2023universal) with 500 harmful behaviors. 
*   ‚Ä¢Linguistic manipulation: We assess our SCoT in defending against linguistic manipulations, such as slang and uncommon dialects. This evaluation employs the sorrybench dataset(xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge), which includes 100 harmful questions for each category. 
*   ‚Ä¢Contextual manipulation: The model‚Äôs resilience to distracted content is tested using tactics like role play, logical appeal, expert endorsement, and evidence-based persuasion from the sorrybench dataset. We further assess our SCoT‚Äôs capability to suppress refusal and encourage affirmative responses, applying these strategies to the JailbreakBench and AdvBench datasets(wei2024jailbroken). 
*   ‚Ä¢Adaptive attack: We employ a fuzzing-based white-box adaptive attack, GCG(zou2023universal), running for 500 iterations with a batch size of 512. The fitness function evaluates the loss of mutations. The implementation is based on the Harmbench(mazeika2024harmbenchstandardizedevaluationframework) framework. 

Results. Table[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S4.T1 "Table 1 ‚Ä£ 4.1 Experiment setup ‚Ä£ 4 Experiment ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") presents the jailbreak attack success rates (ASR) of our SCoT compared to baselines across various attack scenarios. Our SCoT demonstrates a significant improvement in defense, reducing ASR to near zero for direct harmful requests and effectively countering both linguistic and contextual manipulation attacks. In contrast, models such as advTrain, based on Mistral-7B(mazeika2024harmbenchstandardizedevaluationframework), and Circuitbreaker(zou2024circuitbreaker), though trained on a diverse set of harmful prompts, exhibit limited adaptability to novel attack scenarios.

However, SCoT does show a higher ASR than Circuitbreaker in the GCG attack when using the Mistral-7B-based model. Upon further analysis of the compromised samples, we found that all failures fall within the misinformation category. We hypothesize that this may be due to the inherent weaker reasoning ability of the Mistral-7B-based model in specific domains. Overall, SCoT‚Äôs robust mechanism for detecting malicious intent allows it to generalize effectively to unseen attacks, including those targeting refusal suppression and eliciting affirmative responses. These findings underscore the superior generalization capability of SCoT across a wide range of jailbreak scenarios.

### 4.3 Potential Compromise in General Capabilities

Setup. To evaluate potential compromises in general capabilities due to security enhancements, we employ two significant benchmarks: MMLU(hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage) and GSM8K dataset(cobbe2021training). MMLU includes multiple-choice questions across 57 tasks such as elementary mathematics, US history, and computer science. GSM8K is designed to assess model performance on complex problem-solving tasks typical of graduate-level exams.

Table 2: Evaluation of LLM general capabilities using our SCoT and three baseline models. Performance is measured by accuracy, utilizing GPT-4o-mini as the answer cleansing model.

Results. Table[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S4.T2 "Table 2 ‚Ä£ 4.3 Potential Compromise in General Capabilities ‚Ä£ 4 Experiment ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") reveals the trade-offs encountered when bolstering safety defenses. It shows the accuracy metrics across the GSM8K and MMLU datasets. Our SCoT demonstrates minimal performance loss relative to the base model, in contrast to Circuitbreaker, which shows more degradation. This drop in accuracy is likely due to an over-refusal response to questions containing terms that could violate safety protocols.

### 4.4 Ablation Studies

Setup. In our ablation studies, we investigate the impact of various components on our SCoT‚Äôs performance by conducting experiments under two distinct conditions: removing question variants or omitting the Retain dataset from our training regime.

Results. Table[3](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S4.T3 "Table 3 ‚Ä£ 4.3 Potential Compromise in General Capabilities ‚Ä£ 4 Experiment ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") presents the general capacity and a representative set of robustness evaluations for our SCoT using Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B. The data highlights the essential roles of the Retain dataset and question variants in influencing model performance. For Llama3-8B, excluding the retain dataset leads to substantial drops in GSM8K and MMLU accuracies, from 0.85 to 0.33 and 0.73 to 0.37, respectively, underlining its crucial role in enhancing understanding and response accuracy. Conversely, removing question variants slightly reduces MMLU performance from 0.73 to 0.67 but does not significantly affect GSM8K, indicating their lesser yet notable impact on robustness.

Robustness testing shows that without the retain dataset, the model‚Äôs resilience diminishes across all scenarios, especially in handling uncommon dialects and role play, with marked performance declines. In contrast, lacking question variants marginally impacts scenarios like affirmative responses and suppress refusal, highlighting their role in maintaining consistent performance under varied linguistic inputs. Our integrated approach, combining both the Retain dataset and question variants, demonstrates balanced performance improvements or stable robustness compared to configurations lacking these components.

### 4.5 Efficiency

Setup. We further evaluate the efficiency of our SCoT focusing on two key performance indicators: training time and inference time. Training time is measured to assess the computational resources and time required to fully train the model with SCoT under standard conditions. For inference time, we distinguish between benign, direct request harmful, and attack questions. This differentiation allows us to understand how the model performs under varying levels of complexity and potential security threats.

Table 4: Time Spent (in seconds) for inference for different Tasks.

Results. Table[4](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S4.T4 "Table 4 ‚Ä£ 4.5 Efficiency ‚Ä£ 4 Experiment ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought") shows the inference time per sample of our SCoT and the baseline models for different tasks. Inference times reveal that our SCoT method adds computational overhead for safety reasoning in both benign and harmful scenarios. It shows slightly increased times for benign inputs but manages harmful and attack queries more efficiently, indicating robust malicious intent detection and adherence to safety protocols. In contrast, the baseline circuitbreaker configuration maintains similar times for standard tasks but requires significantly more time for harmful inputs, suggesting difficulties in handling scenarios outside its typical parameters. This suggests that the circuitbreaker approach emphasizes more on safeguarding against harmful content but may struggle with out-of-distribution situation.

5 Additional Related Work
-------------------------

In this section, we briefly introduce more broader related work in addition to Section[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.19180v1#S2 "2 Background and Preliminary ‚Ä£ Make Your Guard Learn to Think: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks with Safety Chain-of-Thought").

Jailbreak Attacks. In this work, we discuss linguistic-based and optimization-based jailbreak attacks for single-turn conversations. Various other jailbreak variants also exist. Multi-Shot Jailbreak (MSJ) exploits the strength of In-Context Learning, leveraging millions of harmful demonstrations to compromise LLMs(anil2024manyshot). One strategy for multi-turn attacks is fine-grained task decomposition, which breaks down the original malicious query into several less harmful sub-questions(wang2025mrjagenteffectivejailbreakagent; zhou2024multiroundjailbreakattacklarge; zhou2024speak). While this strategy successfully bypasses current safety mechanisms, it could be countered by incorporating these finer-grained harmful queries into safety training datasets. Alternatively, researchers have proposed using human red teamers to expose vulnerabilities in LLMs against multi-turn attacks(li2024llm). Moreover, some strategies involve gradually steering benign initial queries towards more harmful topics(ren2024derailyourselfmultiturnllm). While these attacks generally aim to deceive LLMs by decomposing or concealing harmful targets, our SCoT‚Äôs proactive identification of harmful intentions could be a promising direction to mitigate these attacks.

Brittleness of Safety Alignment. Recent research has exposed significant vulnerabilities in the safety mechanisms of large language models (LLMs). Apart from jailbreak, studies indicate that altering only a small subset of the model‚Äôs parameters can lead to safety compromises(wei2024assessing; chen2024findingsafetyneuronslarge; anonymous2025identifying). Additionally, when further fine-tuning LLMs with safety alignment on benign datasets, this can paradoxically result in a substantial degradation of their safety features, highlighting the inherent brittleness of current safety alignment practices(yi-etal-2024-vulnerability; he2024safedataidentifyingbenign). These findings emphasize the urgent need for a deeper understanding of safety mechanisms and the development of robust safety defense strategies.

Defense for LLMs safety. Another defense approach against jailbreaks is machine unlearning, which takes a distinct direction by intentionally forgetting all harmful knowledge(zhao2023learning). Circuitbreaker is a method that falls into this category. However, it is challenging to verify that all harmful knowledge has indeed been removed. The efforts most closely related to our work are Deliberative Alignment(guan2025deliberativealignmentreasoningenables) and the Constitutional AI (CAI) framework(bai2022constitutionalaiharmlessnessai), which both focus on refining the reward function within the DPO framework to adhere to predefined fine-grained regulations, aiming to reduce the over-refusal in extremely large models such as ChatGPT or GPT-4. Unlike theaforementioned methods, we focus more on strengthen large models like Llama3-8b to defend against different jailbreak attacks.

6 Discussion
------------

Limitation. Our SCoT has a drawback of slower response times compared to the base model and introduces extra computational costs when processing benign samples. The slowdown is due to the need for in-depth analysis of user requests, which requires more computational resources. Moreover, our SCoT relies on predefined safety regulations during the training phase, which limits its adaptability to new scenarios. Future research could investigate the application of retrieving and reasoning with safety regulations from a policy database(lewis2020retrieval). This approach would enable fine-grained safety reasoning analysis and offer more flexible adaptation to various scenarios, enhancing the model‚Äôs ability to respond dynamically to diverse safety challenges.

7 Conclusion
------------

In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of large language models to the prominent jailbreak attacks. We critique that existing defense mechanisms fail to defeat the advanced attacks due to their inadequate training strategies. We propose SCoT, a novel approach that enhances LLMs by enabling them to assess user intent prior to generating responses. By expanding the training dataset with distractions and employing a reasoning-based safety chain, the safety-enhanced LLM can evaluate request intent against safety regulations. Experimental results demonstrate that SCoT outperforms existing defenses, effectively thwarting various jailbreak attempts and improving model resilience.

Impact Statement
----------------

We present an innovative reasoning-based framework designed to improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) by proactively assessing the potential harmfulness of user queries in line with safety standards prior to providing responses. This method holds considerable potential for impact, especially in tackling OOD scenarios across diverse AI fields beyond safety. Additionally, a notable benefit of this approach is its sample efficiency. By promoting reasoning during post-training, the model can enhance its generalization during the pre-training phase, thereby reducing the need for extensive fine-tuning data.
