The references below highlight new research papers and reports exploring
latent-space manipulations and defenses that emerged after the 2032 snapshot.

- [HSF: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks with Hidden State Filtering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3701716.3717659) – proposes filtering hidden representations to block jailbreak attempts.
- [Understanding Jailbreak Success: A Study of Latent Space Dynamics in Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HuNoNfiQqH) – analyzes how hidden-state trajectories correlate with jailbreak effectiveness.
- [Towards Understanding Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs: A Representation Space Analysis](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.401/) – investigates how representation shifts lead to successful attacks.
- [Model Manipulation Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XmvgWEjkhG) – demonstrates manipulating latent states to assess safety and capability trade-offs.
- [Detecting Machine-Generated Long-Form Content with Latent-Space Variables](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.608.pdf) – shows that latent variables help detect machine-generated text.
- [What Features in Prompts Jailbreak LLMs? Investigating the Mechanisms Behind Attacks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6CaDi1RRS1) – explores how prompt structure manipulates latent vectors during jailbreaks.
