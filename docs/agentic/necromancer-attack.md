The "Necromancer" proof‑of‑concept demonstrates an autonomous agent that repeatedly prompts itself with modified outputs to escalate capabilities. By chaining multiple iterations, the agent can regenerate prompts that bypass earlier safety filters, eventually executing commands or invoking external tools. Researchers showed how this loop can occur with minimal user interaction, effectively a zero‑click jailbreak on connected assistants like Copilot.

Defense teams recommend limiting agent recursion depth and sandboxing any functions invoked through self-issued prompts.
