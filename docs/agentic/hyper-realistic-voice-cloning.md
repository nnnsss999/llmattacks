# Hyper-Realistic Voice Cloning for Agentic Deception

## Summary

This technique focuses on the use of advanced deep learning models to generate hyper-realistic voice clones from minimal audio samples. These voice clones can then be used to deceive autonomous agentic systems that interact with voice commands or to socially engineer humans who might be part of an LLM-driven workflow.

Key aspects include:
- Low-sample voice cloning (e.g., a few seconds of audio).
- Real-time voice conversion capabilities.
- Bypassing voice authentication systems or creating convincing fake instructions for AI agents.

## Relevance

As LLM agents become more integrated with physical systems and voice interfaces, the ability to convincingly fake vocal commands or identities poses a significant threat to security and trust.
