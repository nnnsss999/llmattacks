Autonomous frameworks like **Auto-GPT** and **CrewAI** chain multiple tools and
sub-agents to pursue high-level goals. If a single component is compromised,
malicious commands can propagate through the toolchain, leading to unintended
filesystem access or code execution. Documented incidents show that weak
authorisation checks allow privilege escalation when agents spawn new helper
processes or reuse credentials across tasks.
