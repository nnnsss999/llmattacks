## Summary

This attack vector involves crafting prompts that induce a state of cognitive dissonance within the LLM. By presenting contradictory statements, ethical paradoxes, or information that clashes with the model's training data in a specific sequence, the model's internal consistency checks can be overwhelmed. This may lead to the LLM bypassing its programmed safety guidelines or generating unintended outputs as it struggles to resolve the conflicting inputs.

Key aspects include:
- Exploitation of inherent biases in model training.
- Sequencing of prompts to gradually build up contradictory pressure.
- Targeting models with complex reasoning capabilities.

## Relevance

This technique is significant as it moves beyond simple prompt manipulation to exploit deeper psychological constructs potentially mirrored in LLM architectures.
